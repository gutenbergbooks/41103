<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the study of Waterways of Westward
Expansion, the Ohio River&mdash;the
&ldquo;Gateway of the West&rdquo;&mdash;occupies
such a commanding position that it must
be considered most important and most
typical. Such is its situation in our geography
and history that it is entitled to a
most prominent place among Historic Highways
of America which greatly influenced
the early westward extension of the borders
and the people of the United States. Not
until a late period in the expansion era&mdash;the
day of steam navigation&mdash;did the Great
Lakes rise to importance as highways of
immigration, and south of the Ohio River
Basin there was no westward waterway of
importance. The day of the keel-boat and
barge was of moment in the broadening of
the American sphere of influence on this
continent, and nowhere is the study of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ancient craft made to so good advantage as
on the Ohio and its tributaries.</p>

<p>This monograph is devoted, therefore,
to the part played by this waterway as a
road into the West. The two introductory
chapters, concerning C&eacute;loron and the first
occupation of the Old Northwest, added to
previous volumes of this series (iii, iv, v,
and vi), complete the legendary and historical
setting necessary for a proper view
of the Ohio in the first momentous years of
the nineteenth century. The occupation
and filling of the southern shores of the
Ohio was the story of Volume VI; the story
of the filling of the northern shore is outlined
in the second chapter of this book.
With the position of the first colonies and
settlements in the great valley well comprehended,
and a conception of the origin
of the different colonies and their varied
types, the next logical step in our study is
the rise of the river trade and its evolution.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out to any
reader of these volumes that the Ohio
River was the highway upon which all of
the great early continental routes focused.
Washington&rsquo;s Road, Braddock&rsquo;s Road,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Forbes&rsquo;s Road, and Boone&rsquo;s Road&mdash;like
the Indian and buffalo trails they followed&mdash;had
their goal on the shores of this strategic
waterway. The westward movement was
by river valleys (a fact perhaps never sufficiently
emphasized) and not until the
Tennessee, Monongahela, Kanawha, and
Kentucky Rivers were reached were any
waters found to run parallel with the social
movement itself.</p>

<p>When this goal of half a century was
reached, then followed a half century of
river travel that is being forgotten with
remarkable rapidity. This cannot be realized
until one marks out for himself the
task, for instance, of learning how a keel-boat
was made and how it was operated.
The echo of the steersman&rsquo;s voice and the
tuneful note of the bargeman&rsquo;s horn have
faded from our valleys; and with this music
has passed away a chapter of our history of
vital importance and transcendant human
interest.</p>

<p>For the sum and substance of Chapter
III, the author is indebted, as the title
indicates, to the painstaking labor of one
Zadoc Cramer, a statistical hero of a time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>when a man who could &ldquo;earn his salt&rdquo;
was making a good day&rsquo;s wage, and when
it seemed likely that Pittsburg might
become one of the principal cities of the
West.</p>

<h3>OUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OHIO</h3>


<p>The Ohio River is a greater and more
important stream than is generally
realized. It drains a vast and rich
territory; its northern source is in latitude
42&deg; 20&acute;, while its mouth, thirteen hundred
miles away, is in latitude 37&deg; north. Its
eastern tributaries are in longitude 78&deg;,
while its outlet is in longitude 89&deg; 20&acute;. It
thus comprises 5&deg; 2&acute; of latitude and 11&deg; 20&acute;
of longitude. The Ohio drains a greater
area than the Mississippi above the mouth
of the Missouri; nearly one quarter of the
waters which flow into the Gulf of Mexico
come from it. The lower Mississippi and
Missouri, only, drain more territory than
the Ohio; but the downfall of rain in the
Missouri drainage is not so great in actual
water supply as that which falls within the
214,000 square miles drained by the Ohio.
Moreover, in the district drained by the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
heads of the Ohio, the Allegheny and the
Monongahela (20,000 square miles), it has
been estimated that the ratio of discharge
to downfall is much greater than on any of
the tributaries of the Mississippi. In 1868,
1,342,605,725,800 cubic feet of water passed
Pittsburg, and in 1869, 1,634,846,499,200
cubic feet. At the same time the annual
downfall of rain in the entire Ohio drainage
was twenty and one-half trillion cubic feet,
while the discharge of the Ohio into the
Mississippi at Cairo was five trillion cubic
feet. The ratio of discharge to downfall
therefore was 0.24.</p>

<p>These estimates, which undoubtedly
approximate the truth, are of moment to
our study. Nature cast, with a lavish hand,
her waters where they would count tremendously
in the opening of this continent:
for the waters that fell here flowed into the
West and the social movement was to be
westward. The Ohio, more than any river,
was to influence the flood-tides of immigration.
The provision of water was, comparatively,
abundant; that was the first
necessity. A large proportion of the water
that fell flowed away; that was the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
necessity. It flowed approximately west;
that was the third necessity. Thus it is
that this river, of all rivers, has a place
among the Historic Highways of America
which were controlling forces in the early
days of our national expansion westward.</p>

<p>There are various theories concerning
the name Ohio, the most popular and generally
acceptable being that Ohio was the
English way of spelling and pronouncing
the name Oyo, &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; which the
Indians had given to the river. The
French, who usually translated Indian
names, called the Ohio River La Belle
Rivi&egrave;re. Later came the English, and the
Iroquois name Oyo was Anglicized to Ohio,
the modern name of the river. This
makes a very satisfactory explanation of
La Belle Rivi&egrave;re, were it not that the Reverend
John Heckewelder affirmed that the
French name Belle Rivi&egrave;re was not a translation
from the Indian, since there was no
such Indian word meaning &ldquo;beautiful.&rdquo;
Mr. Heckewelder felt dissatisfied with the
theory that Ohio meant &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; and
while yet associated with the Indians and
familiar with their language, made a study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of their names for the Ohio River with
interesting and enlightening results. In
tracing the derivation of the word Ohio he
shows that, in the Miamis language, O&rsquo;hui
or Ohi, when prefixed, meant &ldquo;very,&rdquo;
while Ohiopeek meant &ldquo;very white&rdquo;
(caused by froth or white caps) and Ohiopeekhanne
meant &ldquo;the white foaming
river.&rdquo; He further states: &ldquo;The Ohio
river being in many places wide and deep
and so gentle that for many miles, in some
places, no current is perceivable, the least
wind blowing up the river covers the surface
with what the people of that country
call &lsquo;white caps;&rsquo; and I have myself witnessed
that for days together, this has been
the case, caused by southwesterly winds
(which by the by are the prevailing winds
in that country) so that we, navigating the
canoes, durst not venture to proceed, as
these white caps would have filled, and
sunk our canoe in an instant. Now, in all
such cases, when the river could not be
navigated with canoes, nor even crossed
with this kind of craft&mdash;when the whole
surface of the water presented white foaming
swells, the Indians would, as the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was at the time, say, &lsquo;juh Ohiopiechen,
Ohiopeek Ohiopeekhanne;&rsquo; and when they
supposed the water very deep they would
say, &lsquo;kitschi Ohiopeekhanne,&rsquo; which means,
&lsquo;verily this is a deep white river.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The traders who penetrated the Indian
country were commonly careless of the
pronunciation of names; any word which
bore a fragment of similarity to the true
name was satisfactory. There is, however,
great excuse for this, as it was impossible
for white men to acquire the &ldquo;Indian ear&rdquo;
and pronounce the gutturals of the Indian
language. Thus the abridgement of many
words was carried to such an extent that
nothing significant of the original Indian
name remains. The newcomer learned of
his predecessor and the &ldquo;nick-names&rdquo; were
adopted and handed down leaving the true
names to pass out of memory and existence.
For instance Pittsburg was commonly called
&ldquo;Pitt&rdquo; by the traders; Youghiogheny,
&ldquo;Yough;&rdquo; Hockhocking, &ldquo;Hocken.&rdquo; Our
word Lehigh has no signification but was
shortened from the original Indian name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Leehauhanne. In this same manner, the
traders adopted the first syllables of the
word Ohiopeekhanne, thus obtaining an
easier name to pronounce and remember.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Heckewelder is probably
the best authority on Indian names
and customs, so that, presumably, his version
of the derivation and meaning of the
name Ohio is the most authentic; but, the
question remains, why should the French
have called it La Belle Rivi&egrave;re? One cannot
pass, however, without noting that in
the Onondaga language there was a word
ojoneri&mdash;the j being pronounced like our
y. The Reverend David Zeisberger, who
compiled a copious dictionary of the Onondaga
language, asserted that ojoneri meant
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; but in an adverbial sense,
describing the manner in which something
is done&mdash;synonymous with our word well.
If the French translated an Indian name
La Belle Rivi&egrave;re, it was the first syllables
of this word, ojoneri, that they translated&mdash;about
as correctly as Washington translated
Illinois when he first heard it &ldquo;Black
Island&rdquo; (&Icirc;le Noire) or Lieutenant-governor
Hamilton of Detroit translated Rivi&egrave;re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
d&rsquo;Anguille (Eel River, as the Indians called
it) as if it were Rivi&egrave;re d&rsquo;Anglais.</p>

<p>It is believed that the famous La Salle
was the discoverer of the Ohio; three years
of his life are unaccounted for at a moment
when, as Fate would have it, we would like
most to know where the brave explorer
went. Suddenly we lose sight of La Salle
near Niagara&mdash;searching earnestly for a
great western river. Where he went we
do not know but there is evidence that he
came to what the French later knew as
La Belle Rivi&egrave;re and descended it to &ldquo;the
Falls,&rdquo; or Louisville, Kentucky, about 1670.</p>

<p>The earliest actual description of the
Allegheny and Ohio Rivers is contained in
the narratives of two men who came to the
Ohio about the middle of the eighteenth
century. Here we find the earliest authentic
experience of travelers on this great
water highway. This first glimpse of the
Allegheny and Ohio is alluring in its suggestiveness;
there is so much to be noted,
between the lines. No story of the Ohio
can be written without presenting the
faintly filled-in pictures of C&eacute;loron and
Bonn&eacute;camps: of the rugged hills, the rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
waters, the humorous scattering of the
Loups and Renards; the solemn proclamations
&ldquo;in a loud voice&rdquo; of sovereignty;
the flotilla of canoes sweeping around the
hill and out of sight. But almost all of
this is left to the imagination; lacking this,
the story is but a meaningless record of
landings and departures, harangues and
horrors. To every reader the story must
appear differently, but to all it must be a
first glimpse of the primeval Ohio.</p>

</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the fifteenth day of
June in the year 1749 a gallant company of
French, with savage allies, under the direction
of Monsieur C&eacute;loron de Bienville,
embarked on the St. Lawrence in twenty-three
canoes at La Chine near Montreal.
Progress was slow for, in addition to the
passengers, provisions, and camp necessities,
the weight of a number of leaden
plates caused the canoes to glide deeply in
the clear waters. It is to the journals of
C&eacute;loron and Father Bonn&eacute;camps, both of
which are preserved in the archives of the
Department of the Marine, in Paris, that
we owe our knowledge of this first recorded
voyage down La Belle Rivi&egrave;re, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
this expedition of 1749 begins the authentic
history of the Ohio River.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>C&eacute;loron and his detachment, with M. de
Contrec&#339;ur as captain, proceeded up the
St. Lawrence and into the lakes. After
coasting the southern shore of Lake Erie,
he arrived at the Chautauqua portage&mdash;now
known as Barcelona or Portland&mdash;on
the sixteenth of July; and with the dawn
of the following day began the ascent of
Chautauqua Creek, called by the French
Rivi&egrave;re aux Pommes. Much patience and
labor was expended on this unnavigable
stream, and it was not until the twenty-second
of the following month that the
band entered Chautauqua Lake, having
spent six days of this time in toiling over
the six-mile portage which connects Chautauqua
Creek with the lake. C&eacute;loron now
voyaged down the lake and on the morning
of the twenty-fourth of July entered Cone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>wango
Creek. The water was low and,
borrowing the words of C&eacute;loron: &ldquo;On the
29th at noon I entered &lsquo;la Belle Rivi&egrave;re&rsquo;
I buried a plate of lead at the foot of a red
oak on the south bank of the river Oyo and
of the Chauougon, not far from the village
of Kanaouagon, in latitude 42&deg; 5&acute; 23&acute;&acute;.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Of this same occasion Father Bonn&eacute;camps
wrote: &ldquo;Finally, overcome with weariness,
and almost despairing of seeing the Beautiful
River, we entered it on the 29th at
noon. Monsieur de C&eacute;loron buried a plate
of lead on the south bank of the Ohio; and,
farther down, he attached the royal coat of
arms to a tree. After these operations, we
encamped opposite a little Iroquois village,
of 12 or 13 cabins; it is called Kananouangon.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is an ancient custom of the French
people to assert claim to lands in their
possession by burying leaden plates at the
mouths of all streams that drain that territory.
When C&eacute;loron started upon his memo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>rable
journey he carried with him six
leaden plates. These plates were about
eleven inches long, seven and a half inches
wide, and one-eighth of an inch thick.
Each was engraved with an appropriate
inscription, leaving a blank space for date
and name of place of deposit at the mouths
of the various streams.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A <i>Proc&egrave;s Verbal</i>,
similar in nature to the inscription on the
plate, was drawn up and signed by the
officers present. To the nearest tree was
tacked a plate of sheet-iron stamped with
the royal arms. The officers and men of
the expedition were drawn up in battle
array and the chief in command shouted
&ldquo;Vive le Roi,&rdquo; declaring possession in the
name of the King of France. La Salle
established this custom on this continent
in the latter part of the seventeenth century
and now this chevalier of the order of
St. Louis penetrates the half-known Central
West to make good the precedent
established fifty years and more ago.</p>

<p>Although the treaty of Aix la Chapelle
ended a tedious war in Europe, many points
of controversy remained unsettled in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
New World. At the conclusion of the war,
England lost no time in taking measures to
occupy the disputed territory. The Ohio
Company was formed and the crown
granted half a million acres to this association
on the condition that settlements
protected by forts be made upon the granted
lands. These demonstrations on the part
of their rivals had aroused the French to
action. The Marquis de la Galissoni&egrave;re,
Governor of Canada, dispatched C&eacute;loron
and his company with orders to descend
La Belle Rivi&egrave;re and take possession of all
the territory drained by it and its tributaries,
in the name of the King of France.
In order to reach the field of action he has
come a forty-four days&rsquo; journey filled with
bitter lessons. Today his first leaden plate
has been buried, and tonight his weary
&ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; have, for the first time, pitched
their camp on the bank of the river in
question. The first act of the real mission
he has come to perform took place this
afternoon with the interment of the plate&mdash;but
that is only one of six! They rest in
disputed territory and already has C&eacute;loron
sent his right-hand man, M. de Joncaire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
on to La Paille Coup&eacute;e,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to reassure the
suspicious savages.</p>

<p>On the thirtieth the expedition moved
on to Paille Coup&eacute;e. Here a council was
conducted by Joncaire whom the Indians
addressed as &ldquo;our child Joncaire.&rdquo; He
had previously been adopted by the Indians
and consequently had a great influence over
them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The &ldquo;speech&rdquo; of the Marquis de
la Galissoni&egrave;re, brought and presented by
C&eacute;loron to the Iroquois, is especially interesting
and to the point, as it plainly shows
the French attitude with reference to the
English:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My children, since I have been at war
with the English, I have learned that that
nation has deceived you; and not content
with breaking your heart, they have profited
by my absence from this country to
invade the land which does not belong to
them and which is mine. This is what
determined me to send to you Mr. C&eacute;loron,
to inform you of my intentions, which are,
that I will not suffer the English on my
land; and I invite you, if you are my true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
children, to not receive them any more in
your villages. I forbid, then, by this belt,
the commerce which they have established
lately in this part of the land, and announce
to you that I will no longer suffer it. If
you attack them you will make them retire
and send them home; by that means you
will be always peaceable in your village.
I will give you all the aid you should expect
from a good father. If you come to
see me, next spring, you will have reason
to be satisfied with the reception which I
will give you. I will furnish you with
traders in abundance, if you wish for them.
I will even place here officers, if that will
please you, to govern you and give you the
good spirit, so that you will only work in
good affairs. The English are more in the
wrong in coming to this land, as the Five
Nations have told them to fly from there
to the mountains. Give serious attention,
my children, to the words which I send
you; listen well, follow it, it is the way to
see always in your villages a haven beautiful
and serene. I expect from you a reply
worthy of my true children. You see the
marks to be respected which I have attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
along La Belle Rivi&egrave;re, which will prove
to the English that this land belongs to me
and that they cannot come here without
exposing themselves to be chased away. I
wish for this time to treat them with kindness
and warn them; if they are wise they
will profit by my advice.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The result of this council was not entirely
satisfactory to the French. It was
too plainly evident that there existed a
feeling in favor of the English. Bonn&eacute;camps
writes in his journal: &ldquo;... and
in the evening he received their reply, that
every one had been satisfied&mdash;if one could
believe it sincere; but we did not doubt
that it was extorted with fear.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Such
fears, however, did not alter the determination
of the French. On July 31, C&eacute;loron
writes: &ldquo;I sojourned at this village, [Paille
Coup&eacute;e] having been stopped by the abundance
of rain, which pleased us much. The
water rose three feet during the night.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The expedition left Paille Coup&eacute;e on the
first of August and journeyed all day &ldquo;between
two chains of mountains, which
bordered the river on the right and left.&rdquo;
Father Bonn&eacute;camps notes that &ldquo;the Ohio
is very low during the first twenty leagues;
but a great storm, which we had experienced
on the eve of our departure, had
swollen the waters, and we pursued our
journey without any hindrance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Under
date of August 1, Father Bonn&eacute;camps,
tourist-like, recounts a snake story, accompanying
it by the impressions of a newcomer
into the Ohio Basin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Chabert on that day caught
seven rattlesnakes, which were the first
that I had seen. This snake differs in no
way from others, except that its tail is terminated
by seven or eight little scales,
fitting one into another, which makes a sort
of clicking sound when the creature moves
or shakes itself. Some have yellowish
spots scattered over a brown ground, and
others are entirely brown, or almost black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are, I am told, very large ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
None of those which I have seen exceed
four feet. The bite is fatal. It is said that
washing the wound which has been received,
with saliva mixed with a little sea-salt,
is a sovereign remedy. We have not
had, thank God, any occasion to put this
antidote to the test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After having marched nearly four leagues
on this first day of August, the party
reached a village of Loups and Renards&mdash;clans
of the Delaware Nation.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Having
been informed of the approach of this
expedition, all except one man had fled.
C&eacute;loron explained to this solitary individual
that he did not mean to harm the Indians,
and invited them &ldquo;to go to the village
lower down, which was but four or five
leagues distant, where he would speak to
them.&rdquo; Proceeding on down the river he
passed another Loup village of about the
same size, six cabins. To these inhabitants
he also addressed himself and
requested them also to go to the most considerable
village, where he promised to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
&ldquo;speak to them on the part of their Father
Onontio.&rdquo; They arrived there a little
after the travelers.</p>

<p>At this &ldquo;considerable village&rdquo; of Loups,
after having progressed eight or nine
leagues in the hot August sun, the tired
company rested during the night. The
second of August was spent at the village,
and C&eacute;loron spoke, conciliating the assembled
savages.</p>

<p>Under date of August 3, Father Bonn&eacute;camps
writes: &ldquo;We continued our route,
and we marched, as on the first day, buried
in the somber and dismal valley, which
serves as the bed of the Ohio.&rdquo; During
this day&rsquo;s journey, two Indian villages were
passed. The first village was abandoned
by its inhabitants in favor of the woods, at
the approach of the expedition. The second
village, Venango,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> consisted of but
nine or ten cabins. C&eacute;loron disembarked
here and spoke to the inhabitants &ldquo;nearly
as I had spoken to the Loups, and re&euml;mbarked
immediately. This evening I
buried a lead plate and the arms of the king
by a tree, and drew up the Proc&egrave;s Ver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>bal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
This second plate was buried
&ldquo;near&rdquo; or &ldquo;underneath&rdquo; a large boulder
upon which were numerous Indian hieroglyphics.
Following the course of the river,
this rock was about nine miles below the
mouth of French Creek, then called Rivi&egrave;re
aux B&#339;ufs by the French. According to
Bonn&eacute;camps: &ldquo;we buried a 2nd plate of
lead under a great rock, upon which were to
be seen several figures roughly graven,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
while C&eacute;loron himself informs us: &ldquo;I ...
have buried on the south bank of the Ohio,
four leagues below the River aux B&#339;ufs,
opposite a bald mountain and near a large
stone, on which are seen several figures,
rather roughly engraved, a lead plate and
attached in the same place to a tree the
arms of the king.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This plate has never
been found.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth, a conference
was held, it being decided that Joncaire
with the chiefs should precede the
party to Attiqu&eacute; and inform the inhabitants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the good intentions of the approaching
band, and to beg them not to flee from
their village. Of this day Father Bonn&eacute;camps
writes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 4th. We continued our route,
always surrounded by mountains&mdash;sometimes
so high that they did not permit us to
see the sun before 9 or 10 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, or [after] 2 or 3 in the afternoon.
This double chain of mountains stretches
along the Beautiful River, at least as far as
rivi&egrave;re &agrave; la Roche (&lsquo;Rocky River&rsquo;). Here
and there, they fall back from the shore,
and display little plains of one or two
leagues in depth.&rdquo; C&eacute;loron seems to
have had his mind too full of serious matters
to notice his surroundings or, at least,
to have given us the benefit of any observations;
and Father Bonn&eacute;camps&rsquo;s eyes are
the first through which we can gaze upon
the primeval Ohio.</p>

<p>On the fourth the expedition made about
fifteen leagues. Camp was broken at an
early hour on the fifth, and after having
journeyed three or four leagues the <i>voyageurs</i>
passed a river, the confluence of which with
the Allegheny, C&eacute;loron describes as &ldquo;very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
beautiful;&rdquo; a league further down they
passed another. &ldquo;They are both south of
la Belle Rivi&egrave;re. On the heights there are
villages of Loups and Iroquois of the Five
Nations. I encamped early to give time
to Mr. de Joncaire to arrive at the village
Attick&eacute;.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>After having journeyed about five leagues
on the sixth they reached Attiqu&eacute; where
they found Joncaire and his chiefs awaiting
their arrival; all the inhabitants of the
village had fled to the woods. &ldquo;I re&euml;mbarked
and I passed the same day the
ancient village of the Chaouanons [Shawanese],
which has been abandoned since the
departure of Chartier and his band, who
were removed from this place by the orders
of the Marquis de Beauharnois, and conducted
to the river Vermillon, in the
Wabash, in 1745.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At this place C&eacute;loron
&ldquo;encountered&rdquo; six English traders
with fifty horses and about one hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and fifty packs of peltry with which they
were returning to Philadelphia. C&eacute;loron
warned these Englishmen against intruding
upon the territory of the French king and
gave them a letter to deliver to the governor
of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>On the seventh they passed a village of
Loups where only three men remained&mdash;&ldquo;the
rest of their people had gone to Chinique,
not daring to remain at home. I
invited these three men to come with me
to Chinique to hear what I had to say to
them.&rdquo; C&eacute;loron tells us that they re&euml;mbarked
and proceeded on down to &ldquo;Written
Rock&rdquo; which was inhabited by the Iroquois
and governed by an old woman<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
who is &ldquo;entirely devoted to the English.&rdquo;
All the savages had fled in alarm from the
village and &ldquo;there only remained ...
six English traders, who came before me
trembling.... I made them the same
summons as to the others, and I wrote to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
their governor.... This place is one of
the most beautiful that until the present I
have seen on the Belle Rivi&egrave;re.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This village was commonly known
throughout the pioneer period as Shannopin&rsquo;s
Town; it was about four miles above
the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela
Rivers. There could be nothing more
singular than the omission of any references
to the Monongahela River, but neither
C&eacute;loron nor Bonn&eacute;camps refer in any wise
to it. As they did not travel at night and
as, from the Ohio River, the Allegheny
does not now, and did not then, appear to
be so important a stream as the Monongahela,
there can be but one explanation for
this astounding omission. As no mention
whatever is made of the Monongahela, and
as no plate was buried here, either C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s
party did not see it, or, believing it took
its rise in Pennsylvania and was already
settled by the English, they tacitly omitted
to claim it for their king. The first supposition
is absurd; the formation of the
country is particularly significant and would
attract the attention of the most unobserv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>ing;
the meeting of the river tides, the
difference in the color of the waters&mdash;everything
would attract the attention of
the <i>voyageur</i>. The second supposition is
inexplicable; the only possible shred of
evidence that the French ever intended
that the English should have even a chance
to claim any land in the Monongahela Valley
is in the Sixth Article of the capitulation
signed by Washington at Fort Necessity
in 1754.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The company spent the night of the seventh
about three leagues below &ldquo;Written
Rock,&rdquo; and as Chiningu&eacute; was but two
leagues below the camp they easily reached
this town, which was one of the &ldquo;most
considerable on the Belle Rivi&egrave;re,&rdquo; the
following day. C&eacute;loron informs us that
this village consisted of fifty cabins of
Loups, Iroquois, and Shawanese, and Father
Bonn&eacute;camps records that they called
it Chiningu&eacute; from its close proximity to a
river of that name.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This place (a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
miles below the present Economy, Pennsylvania)
has figured prominently in later
Indian history as Logstown. Croghan&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i> under date of August, 1749,
says that &ldquo;Monsieur Celaroon with two
hundred French soldiers&rdquo; had passed
through Logstown just before his arrival.
Inquiring of the inhabitants the object of
&ldquo;Celaroon&rsquo;s&rdquo; expedition, he was told that
&ldquo;it was to drive the English away, and by
burying iron plates, with inscriptions on
them at the mouth of each remarkable
creek, to steal away their country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Upon reaching Chiningu&eacute; C&eacute;loron compelled
several English whom he found
established there to leave and sent by them
a letter, similar to the one previously
spoken of, to Governor Hamilton. The
Indians were very suspicious of C&eacute;loron,
and here his Iroquois and Abenaki allies
deserted him. They treated his speech
with contempt and tore down the plates
which had been nailed upon the trees.</p>

<p>C&eacute;loron left Chiningu&eacute; on the eleventh
and at noon of the thirteenth interred a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
plate of lead &ldquo;at the entrance of the river
and on the south bank of the Kenawah,
which discharges itself to the east of the
river Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> According to Bonn&eacute;camps&rsquo;s
journal, the plate was interred at the mouth
of the Kanonouaora. This third plate was
probably buried at the mouth of Wheeling
Creek in West Virginia, though the descriptions
of the place as given by both C&eacute;loron
and Bonn&eacute;camps are so vague that it is
quite impossible to identify positively the
site.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the
fourteenth, the expedition was again on its
way down the river. They passed two
rivers, the entrances of which, C&eacute;loron tells
us, were very beautiful. On the fifteenth
the route was continued, and a leaden plate
was interred &ldquo;at the foot of a maple,
which forms a tripod with a red oak and a
cone pine, at the entrance of the river
Yenanguekouan, on the west shore of
this river ... and in the same place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
attached to a tree the arms of the King.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Father Bonn&eacute;camps gives, as the name of
this river, Jenangu&eacute;koua. This, the fourth
plate, was interred at the mouth of the
Muskingum River in Ohio, on the site of
old Fort Harmar and within the present
city of Marietta. This plate, found in
1798 by some boys bathing in the Muskingum,
was presented to the Antiquarian
Society of Massachusetts in the library of
which it is now preserved.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth at nine o&rsquo;clock, the
party resumed its journey, making nearly
twelve leagues. On the seventeenth C&eacute;loron
makes record of having seen two
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; rivers the names of which he
says he does not know. &ldquo;I disembarked
early to hunt, being altogether reduced to
a diet of bread.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The journey was resumed at an early
hour the next day, but the party was forced
to camp at noon, as the rain prevented their
continuing. On this day, the eighteenth
of August, the fifth leaden plate was
&ldquo;buried, at the foot of a tree, on the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>ern
shore of the Ohio and the eastern shore
of Chiniondaista.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Father Bonn&eacute;camps
gives the name of this river, the Great
Kanawha, Chinodaichta. The spelling of
the name on the plate, which was found in
1846 and has been preserved by the Virginia
Historical Society, differs somewhat from
that of the <i>Journal</i>, that on the plate being
Chinodahichetha. This place, where the
fifth plate was interred, was named Point
Pleasant, West Virginia, by the early settlers
and still bears that name.</p>

<p>At this point the expedition was delayed
on account of rain, but all re&euml;mbarked on
the twentieth, and during the day encountered
a Loup, who, upon being asked how
many inhabitants there were at St. Yotoc,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
replied there were eighty or a hundred
cabins. On the following day Joncaire,
two chiefs of the Sault de St. Louis, three
Abenakis chiefs, and M. de Niverville
were sent ahead to St. Yotoc &ldquo;to tranquilize
the nations and restore their spirits, in case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
any carrier of news had troubled them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>C&eacute;loron gave his envoys a start of several
hours before resuming his journey. By
embarking early on the morning of the
twenty-second, they were enabled to reach
St. Yotoc that day, and encamped opposite
the village. The next three days were
spent in holding councils. The Chaouanons
(Shawanese) inhabitants of &ldquo;St.
Yotoc&rdquo; were very suspicious of the French
and their intentions. Bonn&eacute;camps says:
&ldquo;Monsieur the Commandant had great
difficulty to reassure them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The situation
of the village of the Chaouanons is
quite pleasant&mdash;at least, it is not masked
by the mountains, like the other villages
through which we had passed. The Sinhioto
river, which bounds it on the West,
has given it its name. It is composed of
about sixty cabins. The Englishmen there
numbered five. They were ordered to
withdraw, and promised to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expedition embarked on the morning
of the twenty-sixth of August and reached
Rivi&egrave;re la Blanche<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that night at ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
o&rsquo;clock. Here they waited two days for Le
Baril, the chief, and his band of Miamis, to
join them and proceed to La Demoiselle to
hear C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;Finally, on the
morning of the 31st, they appeared, followed
by their women, their children, and
their dogs. All embarked, and about 4
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon we entered Rivi&egrave;re
&agrave; la Roche, after having buried the 6th and
last leaden plate on the western bank of
that river,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and to the north of the
Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> &ldquo;I ... have buried on the
point formed by the right shore of the
Ohio, and the left of the River la Roche, a
plate of lead, and attached to a tree the
arms of the king.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>With the burial of this sixth and last
leaden plate, which, so far as known, has
never been discovered, C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s voyage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
on La Belle Rivi&egrave;re ended, and on the
morning of the first of September the
canoes began the ascent of the shallow
Rivi&egrave;re &agrave; la Roche en route to Quebec by
way of Lake Erie.</p>

<p>Through the eyes of these travelers the
Governor of New France looked upon the
great valley of the Ohio and realized its
extent and strategic value. The many
large rivers entering it, the Indian villages
which dotted its banks and, more than all
else, the avidity of English traders for the
fur trade of these villages, were the items
in the report of these first <i>voyageurs</i> which
led quickly to the French fort-building here
and precipitated the old French War.</p>

<h3>THE INDIAN SIDE</h3>


<p>The campaign of General John Forbes
in 1758, which ended French rule on
the Ohio, gave the Ohio Valley to
the English. From this time on, the entire
sweep of territory between the Atlantic
Ocean and the present Pittsburg may be
termed English territory. While England
now nominally came into possession of all
of this portion of New France, the lands on
either side of the Ohio River below Pittsburg
were claimed by the Indian nations
inhabiting them, and the Crown attempted,
in the Proclamation of 1763, to preserve
these lands for the Indians by prohibiting
the migrations of the colonists. The Treaty
of Fort Stanwix in 1768, and the expansion
of Virginia into the vast tract south of the
Ohio have been recounted.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It is sufficient
to recall here that this treaty gave to Virginia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the entire southern bank of the Ohio
and all the territory southward to the banks
of the Tennessee. The treaty was made
with the Iroquois, the conquerors of half a
continent, not with the Delawares and
Shawanese and Southern Nations, who
camped and hunted there. These dependents
of the Iroquois contested the treaty
stoutly and not until 1774 did the Shawanese
even pretend to agree to its stipulations.
This agreement was secured by what is
known as Dunmore&rsquo;s War and was the
direct result of General Andrew Lewis&rsquo;s
bloody victory over the allied Indians at the
mouth of the Great Kanawha River, October
10, 1774. It is not less than significant
that this decisive battle which assured the
Old Southwest to the Americans, should
have been fought practically over the burial
place of C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s fifth leaden plate which
claimed the land for France. By the time
of the outbreak of the Revolutionary War,
the entire southern shore of the Ohio had
been abandoned by Indians, though for
many years they continually invaded the
pleasant country which was fast filling with
a scattered white population.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the conquest and occupation
of the northern side of the Ohio River is
as bitter and bloody a tale as that of the
southern side. The artificial division of
the Middle West into states has resulted in
some very artificial historical distinctions;
the Ohio River has perhaps never been
considered a mighty boundary line on the
brink of which civilization paused for many
critical years. The northern bank of the
Ohio was, through many years, known as
the &ldquo;Indian Side;&rdquo; and while western
Virginia and Kentucky were counting their
tens of thousands, the &ldquo;Indian Side&rdquo; was
forbidden territory. The Ohio River was
the western boundary of the colonies and
of the United States for seventeen years:
from 1768 until 1785. When, in 1783, the
United States by the Treaty of Paris came
into possession of the territory between the
Alleghenies and the Mississippi, the &ldquo;men
who wore hats&rdquo; had not purchased an acre
of land north and west of the Ohio River
from its bareheaded inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 1785 at the Treaty of Fort McIntosh
the United States secured from its actual
possessors (the Iroquois claims having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
satisfied at a second treaty at Fort Stanwix,
October 1784) the first grant of land north
of the Ohio. The western boundary line
of the United States now began on Lake
Erie, ascended the Cuyahoga, descended
the Tuscarawas to the site of Fort Laurens,
ran west to the portage between the Miami
and St. Mary Rivers; ascending the Maumee
to Lake Erie it followed the lake shore
to the starting point. The lands south,
east, and west of this line were given to
the United States so far as the Indians
&ldquo;formerly claimed the same.&rdquo; This was
the first of a long series of treaties each of
which gave the northwest side of the Ohio
River to the United States.</p>

<p>Thus in 1785 the Ohio Valley legally
became a part of the territory of the United
States.</p>

<p>By an ordinance immediately passed by
Congress, this tract of land north of the
Ohio River was ordered to be surveyed, the
lots to be sold by the Government in order
to create a fund to pay the war debt. A
geographer and surveyors were appointed
to survey and plat seven ranges of townships
westward from the Pennsylvania<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
boundary. These were to be sold by townships
by commissioners of the loan office of
the several states after proper advertisement.</p>

<p>Thus, at the stroke of a pen, the Ohio
River became a division line between
empires differing wholly from each other.
The &ldquo;Virginia Side&rdquo; was peopled by southerners
according to the Virginia system,
which allowed a man to take and mark for
himself unappropriated lands. Thus the
entire southern shore of the Ohio had been
occupied by Virginians, Pennsylvanians,
and North Carolinians. By act of Congress
the New England system was extended to
the land lying north of the Ohio; the land
was to be properly surveyed and sold. The
Ohio River at once became the western projection
of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s Line. In some
such way as Chevalier has suggested, the
Ohio River became a division fence between
Roundhead and Cavalier. South of the
river, lands were taken up by southerners
in the old Virginia way; north of the river
the New England system obtained, as
though prophesying that the dominant race
was to be of New England stock. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
momentous turning point in the history of
the Central West when Congress made the
New England system operative on the
&ldquo;Indian Side&rdquo; of the Ohio, banishing at
once and forever from that great area the
strife and suffering caused by the thousand
conflicts of overlapping &ldquo;tomahawk claims&rdquo;
and incorrect and confusing &ldquo;surveys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But these acts of Congress were far
more easily passed than enforced. In the
first place, even before the land north of
the Ohio was purchased by the United
States, white settlers began crossing the
Ohio and settling on the &ldquo;Indian Side.&rdquo;
By the year 1780 the Indian Side of the
river had been quite wrested from the
savages, at least from Pittsburg down to the
Scioto. Mclntosh had built Fort Laurens
on the Tuscarawas and, with the help of
others, the Delawares had been driven from
the Muskingum Valley. Clark had captured
Illinois and it was now a part of
Virginia. Many invasions from Kentucky
had passed up the Scioto and the Miamis,
In all these campaigns the soldiery was
largely made up of the border settlers
of western Pennsylvania and Virginia, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
they somehow conceived the notion that
they were as much entitled as any one to
the splendid lands from which they had
driven the Indians. Heretofore the states
and the Government had done everything
in reason to encourage the western movement
and protect it. No one perhaps
realized that the Ohio River was to be
considered, in any sense, a boundary line.
Yet the United States recognized the Indian
right and took such means as were possible
to accomplish an utterly impossible thing.
The lands on the northern side of the Ohio
River were to be preserved to the Indians
until purchased from them. It was even
decreed that retaliatory raids of the whites
should not cross the Ohio. As early as
1779 &ldquo;trespassers&rdquo; of a law as inherently
impossible as the Proclamation of 1763,
made settlements on the Indian Side of the
Ohio &ldquo;from the river Muskingum to Fort
Mclntosh, and thirty miles up some of the
branches of the Ohio river.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Colonel
Brodhead at Fort Pitt immediately despatched
Captain Clark to drive off the
intruders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The commissioners at the Fort Mclntosh
treaty (1785) were not blind to such possibilities,
and took occasion to forward the
following instructions to Colonel Harmar
at Fort Pitt, January 24, 1785: &ldquo;Surveying
or settling the lands not within the limits
of any particular State being forbid by the
United States, in Congress assembled, the
commander will employ such force as he
may judge necessary in driving off persons
attempting to settle on the lands of the
United States.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The task laid upon Colonel
Harmar was a most unpopular and
impossible one. By this time the country
south of the Ohio was teeming with a great
restless population.</p>

<p>There were, by 1785, a hundred thousand
people in what we know as West Virginia
and Kentucky. The first comers had fallen
upon the very best lands and appropriated
them. There is no doubt that all the fertile
&ldquo;bottoms&rdquo; along the southern shore
of the Ohio River had been &ldquo;staked out&rdquo;
and more or less &ldquo;improved&rdquo; by this time.
Washington alone, through his agents
Crawford and Freeman, had secured not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
less than sixty thousand acres on the Ohio
and Little and Great Kanawha before this
time. Other far-sighted, enterprising men,
like Patrick Henry, had secured other tracts
of land. It must be remembered, too, that
this was a day of no roads; lands lying
away from the immediate river valleys
could be reached and improved only with
the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>It is therefore no wonder that the southern
shore of the Ohio was crowded at this
time with a swarm of pioneers whose uncouth
faces and unkempt appearance suggested
plainly the labor they had endured to
reach and hold the river&mdash;their goal.
They looked across to the fertile bottoms
on the Indian Side and the splendid
stretches of land in the valleys of the
Muskingum, Hocking, Scioto, and Miami
Rivers. They and their children had conquered
that land; under a score of fierce
leaders they had flung themselves upon the
upper Muskingum and driven the Delawares
away to the Lakes, or upon the Scioto and
sent the Shawanese scurrying up the Sandusky
or Maumee. Yet there on the trees
on the other side were nailed proclamations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
from the commanding officer at Fort Pitt
warning them against settling on those lands.</p>

<p>Little wonder they defied the proclamation.
In less than two months after Colonel
Harmar had received the instructions
to drive off all settlers from these lands of
the United States, he sent a force under
Ensign Armstrong down the river from
Pittsburg. His report was most alarming;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
he affirmed that there were three
hundred families at the falls of the Hocking
and an equal number on the Muskingum;
on the Miami and Scioto Rivers the number
of &ldquo;intruders&rdquo; was placed at fifteen hundred.
&ldquo;From Wheeling to that place
[Miami],&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;there is scarcely one
bottom on the river but has one or more
families living thereon.&rdquo; These settlers
&ldquo;were equal to self-government,&rdquo; writes
William Henry Smith, &ldquo;and, if undisturbed,
would soon have laid the foundations
of a State on the Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Indeed,
a call was issued by these pioneers March
12, 1785, for an election of members to a
convention for the framing of a constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
for the government of a new state; elections
were to be held at the mouths of the
Miami, Scioto, and Muskingum Rivers and
one at the house of Jonas Menzons in the
present Belmont County, Ohio. The advertisement
of these elections was signed
by John Emerson and its final paragraph
denied the right of Colonel Harmar to
dispossess the settlers on the Indian Side,
in the following terms:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do certify that all mankind, agreeable
to every constitution formed in America,
have an undoubted right to pass into every
vacant country, and there to form their
constitution, and that from the confederation
of the whole United States, Congress
is not empowered to forbid them, neither
is Congress empowered from that confederation
to make any sale of uninhabited
lands to pay the public debts, which is to
be by a tax levied and lifted [collected] by
authority of the Legislature of each
State.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 31, 1786, a treaty was concluded
at the mouth of the Great Miami
with the Shawanese. The United States
received from that dangerous nation a title
to the lower Ohio Valley. But the general
government was by this time at its wits&rsquo;
end to keep the acquired territory from the
restless inhabitants of its own impoverished
colonies. Colonel Harmar wrote the Secretary
of War now that he had, by force of
arms, driven off all intruders for a distance
of seventy miles below Pittsburg, but that
the number beyond &ldquo;was immense&rdquo; and
that nothing could prevent the lands being
occupied in the old Virginia way &ldquo;unless
Congress enters into immediate measures.&rdquo;
Congress took the cue and resolved that if
troops stationed at Pittsburg could not
enforce its commands, a new garrison must
be established on the lower Ohio. Accordingly
Colonel Harmar was ordered to take
post on the north side of the Ohio between
the Muskingum and the Miami Rivers,
where he could successfully keep the front
ranks of the immigration army from crossing
the river, and where he could also
protect the surveyors of the seven ranges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
from any insults of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Under
this order Fort Harmar was erected at the
mouth of the Muskingum River (Marietta,
Ohio) in 1785. Fort Harmar and Fort
Finney, erected at the mouth of the Miami,
nominally accomplished the purposes for
which they were erected; the immigration
movement across the Ohio was stopped
until preparations had been made for it.
They were the first legal homes of Americans
north of the Ohio River after the
Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>In the meantime propositions for the
government of this great region north of
the Ohio River were being debated in
Congress; and finally it was declared to be
the &ldquo;Territory Northwest of the River
Ohio&rdquo; by the Ordinance of 1787. This
famous act had been pending three years
in Congress, but was passed within twelve
days of the arrival in New York of Dr.
Manasseh Cutler, hero-preacher and skilled
diplomat; he came as the authorized agent
of an Ohio Company of Associates which
had been formed by Revolutionary veterans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
under the leadership of General Rufus
Putnam in Boston in 1786 with special
reference to the western land bounties
promised by Congress in 1776 to faithful
soldiers. The Ordinance organized from
the lands ceded to the government by the
several states the magnificent territory now
occupied by the states of Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The
act itself was conceived in a petition signed
by these Revolutionary soldiers composing
the Ohio Company of Associates, and forwarded
by General Putnam to General
Washington, praying that the Government
redeem its worthless scrip by grants of
western land.</p>

<p>This a grateful government was willing
to do. The difficulty was that it would be
hazardous to organize a territory, to be
suckled and protected at great expense,
unless a considerable fraction of the area
thus organized should be populated and
developed by worthy citizens. The Ohio
Company of Associates offered to take a
million and a half acres. This was not
satisfactory to the delegates in Congress.
It was a mere clearing in all that vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
stretch of territory between the Ohio, the
Mississippi, and the Great Lakes. It was,
therefore, on a momentous mission of reconciliation
that Dr. Cutler hurried to New
York. The &ldquo;Territory Northwest of the
River Ohio&rdquo; could not be erected unless the
Ohio Company took a considerable part of
the lands. The Ohio Company, on the
other hand, could not take land without
the assurance that it was to be an integral
part of the United States. The Ohio Company
would make the Ordinance possible;
the Ordinance made the Ohio Company&rsquo;s
purchase possible.</p>

<p>In order to realize the hopes of his
clients, and, at the same time, satisfy the
demands of the delegates at Congress, Dr.
Cutler added to the grant of the Ohio Company
an additional grant of three and a half
million acres, taken by a Scioto Company
on behalf of Colonel Duer and others.
Thus by a stupendous speculation, unhappy
in its results but compromising in no way
the Ohio Company or its agent, and by
shrewdly, though without dissimulation,
announcing his determination to obtain
lands from the individual states if Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
would not now come to terms, Dr. Cutler
won a signal victory. The famed Ordinance
was passed, corrected almost to the
letter of his amendments, and Congress
entered into the greatest private contract it
had ever made. It was signed by Dr.
Cutler and Major Winthrop Sargent for the
Ohio Company and Samuel Osgood and
Arthur Lee for the Treasury Department,
October 27, 1787.</p>

<p>Speaking in general terms, therefore,
the Ohio Valley from the Pennsylvania
line to the mouth of the Muskingum was,
in 1785-86, surveyed into the &ldquo;Seven
Ranges;&rdquo; southwest of this, down the
valley, came the Ohio Company grant of
1787. This embraced the lands from the
seventh through the seventeenth range.
The earnestness of these New Englanders
is suggested by the immediate payment of
half a million dollars down, when the contract
was signed with the United States,
and by the immediate arrival on the Ohio
of the Ohio Company&rsquo;s vanguard of settlers.
These forty-eight &ldquo;Pilgrims of
Ohio,&rdquo; under the leadership of the noble
Putnam, reached the Youghiogheny by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
way of the Old Glade Road through Pennsylvania
in the midwinter of 1787-88. On
the seventh of the following April they
landed at the mouth of the Muskingum.
Here, across the Muskingum from Fort
Harmar, they built their pioneer castle,
around which grew up Marietta&mdash;named
in honor of Marie Antoinette, whom its
founders, old Revolutionary veterans, had
learned to love. In July, General Arthur
St. Clair, the newly-appointed governor of
the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio
arrived, and with imposing ceremony, the
administration of the great Territory was
inaugurated. Within two years five colonies
had been planted by the Ohio Company,
four in the Muskingum Valley and
one on the Ohio, opposite the mouth of the
Little Kanawha River. The &ldquo;Indian
Side&rdquo; of the &ldquo;white foaming river&rdquo; had
now received its first permanent quota of
white settlers.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same year, 1787, John Cleves
Symmes and associates, largely from New
Jersey, entered into correspondence with
Congress for the purchase of a million acres
of land north of the Ohio, lying between
the Little and Great Miami Rivers. This
&ldquo;Symmes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Miami&rdquo; purchase was
achieved, and the Marietta pioneers saw
the Miami settlers passing down the Ohio
late in 1788 en route to their lands two
hundred miles away. In point of daring
no pioneer movement in America, save
only the founding of Boonesborough, Kentucky,
was more plucky than the founding
of what is now Cincinnati. In December,
Losantiville (Cincinnati) was settled, opposite
the mouth of the Licking River. The
Symmes company also settled Columbia, at
the mouth of the Little Miami, and North
Bend (Indiana) a little to the west. Each
of the three settlements vied with the
others for supremacy. Judge Symmes
located at North Bend, but Fort Washington
was erected at Losantiville and, the
name being changed to Cincinnati, that
settlement became the metropolis of the
Ohio River below Pittsburg; the seat of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
government of the Northwest Territory
was moved hither in 1790.</p>

<p>Therefore in 1790, when the Indian War
broke out, the northern bank of the Ohio
was settled, in a certain sense, between the
mouths of the Muskingum and Scioto and
the mouths of the Little and the Great
Miami. But these light spots in all the
darkness of the Black Forest, as the West
was familiarly called, were, after all, but
one shade lighter than the surrounding wilderness.
The population of the Ohio Company
settlements was only a few score;
Cincinnati, six years after its founding,
could only number, garrison and all, an
equal number of hundreds. The founders
of Cincinnati, like those of Marietta, were of
the best of colonial and revolutionary stock;
but, because of the contaminations of the
rough frontier, their settlements became
what Pittsburg was throughout its early
history. General Richard Butler, had he
lived, might well have written Governor
St. Clair at Cincinnati in 1800 the same
words he penned General Irvine at Pittsburg
in 1782&mdash;&ldquo;am happy to find you can
manage the d&mdash;ls of that country and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
b&mdash;tes of the garrison.&rdquo; Of Pittsburg in
1782 General Irvine wrote his wife:
&ldquo;There never was, nor I hope will there
ever be, such a wretched, villainous place
as this.&rdquo; Of Marietta, equally disagreeable
pictures were drawn by contemporaneous
writers. It was a question whether or not
the leaven of New England could leaven
the whole lump. It did&mdash;with the help of
good Virginian blood.</p>

<p>The next tract of land to be opened was
that lying between the Ohio Company&rsquo;s
purchase and Judge Symmes&rsquo;s, a six thousand
square mile tract bounded on the east
by the Scioto and on the west by the Little
Miami. This was the Virginia Military
District. The Old Dominion had voted
her soldiers upon continental and state
establishment bounties in western lands.
The land that was granted (practically the
old Henderson purchase between the Green
and Tennessee Rivers) did not prove large
enough. Virginia, guarding against this
very contingency, had reserved the tract
between the Scioto and Little Miami for
bounty lands when she ceded her county of
Illinois to the Government in 1784. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>fore
in 1790 Congress passed a law &ldquo;directing
the Secretary of War to make return
to the Governor of Virginia of the names
of the Virginia officers and men entitled to
bounty-lands, and the amount in acres due
them.&rdquo; The same act authorized the agents
of the said troops to locate and survey for
their use, between the two rivers, apparently
in the wretched Virginia fashion,
such a number of acres of land as, together
with the number already located on the
waters of the Cumberland, would make the
amount to which they were entitled; these
locations and surveys to be recorded,
together with the names of those for whom
they were made, in the office of the Secretary
of State. The President was then
directed to issue letters patent for these
lands to the persons entitled to them, for
their use or the use of their heirs, assigns,
or legal representatives. The Secretary of
State should forward these deeds to the
executive of Virginia, to be delivered to
the proper persons. It will be seen that
the national Government issued the deeds,
but did not make the surveys.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian War which raged from 1790
to 1795 was fought almost wholly north of
the Ohio River basin with Fort Washington
as the base of supplies.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The conflict
delayed the pioneer movement into the Ohio
Valley but, after the treaty of Greenville
(1795), the movement was renewed with a
rush. The Virginia Military District now
(1796) began filling with Virginians, and
under good and great men such as General
Nathaniel Massie and Duncan McArthur,
subsequently governor of Ohio, became a
power in the old Northwest.</p>

<p>We have intimated that the original Ohio
Company purchase and the Virginia Military
District adjoined; upon the utter failure
of the Scioto Company, which had been
a party with the Ohio Company in its first
contract, the additional lands taken by
Colonel Duer came again into the possession
of the United States and were known
as Congress Lands. This tract embraced
about four thousand square miles and
stretched over the twenty odd miles on the
Ohio between the Ohio Company lands and
those of the Virginia Military District.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus at the opening of the actual pioneer
period, about 1800, we find both shores of
the Ohio dotted with settlements. In Virginia
and Kentucky there are Pittsburg,
Charleston, Wheeling, Limestone (Maysville),
and Louisville; and on the old-time
Indian Side are Beaver (Fort Mclntosh),
Wellsburg, Marietta (Fort Harmar), Gallipolis,
Manchester, Columbia, Cincinnati;
and Madison and Clarksville, Indiana. By
1800 there are forty-five thousand inhabitants
in the entire Northwest Territory, of
which probably twenty-five thousand are in
the Ohio Valley. Kentucky contains a
population of over two hundred thousand;
not such a large fraction are on the Ohio
however, as is true in the Northwest Territory.
The question of conquest is past,
though still for a decade the British, who
have sullenly withdrawn across the Detroit
River, will continue to incite the Indians
until Harrison shall annihilate Tecumseh&rsquo;s
confederacy at Tippecanoe in 1811. But so
far as the Ohio Valley is concerned the question
is one of occupation; and now come
the streams of immigration from all easterly
points of the compass to this great waterway.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;THE NAVIGATOR&rdquo;</h3>


<p>As the eighteenth century neared its
close the great highways converging
upon Pittsburg and its neighboring
towns on the Youghiogheny and Monongahela
became the routes of the great flood-tide
of immigration which in a day filled
the Middle West with towns and cities.
The emigrant reached navigable waters at
Pittsburg, if he came over Forbes&rsquo;s Road
or the Pittsburg Pike; if he followed Braddock&rsquo;s
Road he found himself on navigable
waters at Brownsville, or, continuing the
land journey, he reached Wheeling on the
Ohio. If he came over the Genesee Road
through New York he would reach the Allegheny
waters at Warren or Watertown,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>At any of these points he would, perhaps,
provide himself with a handbook of information
concerning his prospective route.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
One of these, <i>The Navigator</i>, was published
in Pittsburg in the first year of the nineteenth
century by Zadok Cramer. Its title-page
(fifth edition) affirms the book to be
&ldquo;the trader&rsquo;s useful guide in navigating
the Monongahela, Allegheny, Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers; containing an ample
account of these much admired waters,
from the head of the former to the mouth
of the latter; a concise description of their
towns, villages, harbours, settlements, &amp;c
with particular directions how to navigate
them, in all stages of the water, pointing
out their rocks, ripples, channels, islands,
bluffs, creeks, rivers &amp;c. and the distances
from place to place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the typical emigrant would not
secure such a guide book but the information
for which he made eager inquiry at his
port of embarkation is contained here and
is of great interest to the student of the times
because of the variety of matters treated.
Of the Ohio and its two great tributaries
let us quote the following information:</p>


<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Monongahela</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This river rises at the foot of the Lau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>rel
Mountain, in Virginia, thence meandering
in a N. by E. direction, passes into
Pennsylvania, and receives Cheat river from
the S.S.E. Thence winding to a N. by
W. direction, separates Fayette and Westmorland
from Washington county, and
passing into Allegheny county receives the
Youghiogheny river at Pittsburgh, fifteen
miles below the mouth of the former, and
by land, fifty-five below Cheat. The Monongahela
is about 450 yards wide at its
mouth, measuring from the top of bank to
bank, and in the fall and spring freshes has
water enough to carry ships of 400 tons
burthen; these, however, subside quickly
and render the navigation for such vessels
very precarious. One great difficulty
attending the navigation of vessels of
burden down this river arises from the
almost impossibility of keeping them in the
proper channel, it being in many places
very narrow, and full of short turns around
points of islands which are numerous. This
observation will also apply to the Ohio,
especially as low down as Wheelen [Wheeling],
ninety miles below Pittsburgh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waters of the Monongahela River,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
in those days as in these, were very muddy,
and had it not been for the magnificent
trees which abundantly lined the firm
banks, the stream could not have been
termed very beautiful. These trees were
chiefly walnuts, black-oaks, hickories,
maples, and button-woods, and afforded a
bountiful supply of logs for the many sawmills
which the pioneers had already
erected along the river at the mouths of the
various tributaries. Mr. Cramer tells us
that the lumber obtained from these logs
was floated down to Pittsburg, Wheeling,
or some more remote point, and sold for a
price ranging from a dollar to a dollar and
a half per hundred feet. The country of
the Monongahela was, even at this early
day (1806), well populated; the land along
the river was fertile and productive, and
sold at any price from twelve to thirty
dollars an acre. The &ldquo;bottoms&rdquo; contained
many valuable sugar-maples and
Cramer estimated that, if properly managed,
each tree would yield four pounds of
maple-sugar per annum&mdash;about one dollar
a tree each season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mean velocity of the current of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
this river is about two miles an hour, and
is in a middling state of the water, uninterrupted
with falls, impeding the navigation,
from Morgantown to its mouth, a distance
of one hundred miles; thence upwards the
navigation is frequently interrupted by
rapids, but is navigable however for small
crafts for fifty or sixty miles further. The
west branch in high water is navigable for
fifteen miles, and communicates with a
southern branch of the Little Kenhawa,
by a portage of eight miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to <i>The Navigator</i>, such cereals
as wheat, oats, barley, rye, and buckwheat
were already raised to &ldquo;great perfection&rdquo;
in the valley of the Monongahela. It was
a soil especially adapted to raising exceptional
wheat crops and Mr. Cramer informs
us that the flour made from Monongahela
Valley wheat sold for two dollars more per
barrel in New Orleans than Kentucky
flour. Apples and peaches were staple
fruit crops of the Monongahela country
and these fruits were not infrequently
made into brandy. Peach brandy was a
luxury in the South and sold at a dollar a
gallon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Allegheny</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a beautiful, large and navigable
river, taking its rise in Lycoming county,
P. within a few miles of the head waters of
Sinemahoning creek, a navigable stream
that falls into the Susquehanna river, to
which there is a portage of 23 miles.
Thence pursuing a N. course passes into
New-York state, winding to the N. W.
about 20 miles, turns gradually to the S.
W. enters Pennsylvania, and meandering
in about that direction 180 miles, joins the
Monongahela at Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Few rivers and perhaps none excel the
Allegheny for the transparency of its
waters....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its mean velocity is about two miles
and a half an hour. In its course it receives
many large and tributary streams; among
these are the Kiskimenetas, Mohulbuckitum,
Tobas, French creek, &amp;c. French
creek is navigable to Waterford; thence to
Lake Erie is but fifteen miles portage. To
render the communication more complete
the legislature of Pennsylvania have passed
a law for the erection of a turnpike between
Waterford and Erie. Another communica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>tion
to lake Erie is by way of Chataughque
creek and lake; here is a portage of only
nine miles, and affording ground for an
excellent waggon road. We understand a
ware-house is already established at Chautaughque
lake. The navigation by this
route is said to be the best of the two. At
the mouth of a creek, also called Chautaughque
emptying into lake Erie, a town
has been recently laid off called Portland
nine miles from Chataughque lake. This
town is about thirty miles below the town
of Erie, and ten below the line between
Pennsylvania and New-York, John M&rsquo;Mahon
proprietor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trade between the Allegheny River
and the Lakes was at this time well established
and, it was predicted, would become
of great importance. Pittsburg was receiving
from Onondaga salt works in New
York State two thousand barrels of salt
annually. Immense quantities of timber
were also constantly being hurried toward
their destinations by the current of the
Allegheny. Quite an extensive trade in
salt fish from Lake Erie was carried on in
1806, and Mr. Cramer expresses an earnest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
hope that this trade would be encouraged
to the extent of superseding the importing
of fish from beyond the mountains, for the
fish brought over the mountains then cost
twelve cents while those from Lake Erie
could be offered for four cents and perhaps
less per pound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In return we could send up whiskey,
bar-iron, castings, cider, bacon, apples,
glass, nails, &amp;c. and this would be keeping
trade among ourselves, which is always
preferable to the sending away specie for
articles of home consumption. It has been
suggested that merchandize could be bro&rsquo;t
to Pittsburgh from New-York, by way of
the lake and down this river, for about
three cents a pound, which is one half less
than is given from Philadelphia. By this
route, there would be a portage of fifteen
miles from Albany on the Hudson to Schenectada
on the Mohawk, 10 miles around
the falls of Niagara, and fifteen between
Erie and Waterford, making in all forty
miles land carriage from New-York to
Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvanians, however,
are struggling for a turnpike road all the
way over the mountains, which when com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>pleated,
will no doubt tend to lessen the
very heavy carriages that are now paid on
merchandize of all kinds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The current of the Allegheny River is
much more rapid than that of the Monongahela;
and in the days of <i>The Navigator</i>,
as now, the clear, transparent waters of the
Allegheny marked their course across the
yellow, muddy waters of the Monongahela.
And even three miles below the junction,
the waters of the Allegheny were to be
distinguished from the Monongahela.
&ldquo;Here [at the junction of the two rivers]
the Allegheny is about 450 yards wide,
and when an island lying to the right is
completely washed away, which is accomplishing
rapidly, the river here will be at
least 800 yards wide. Will not the inquiring
mind, on examination, have cause
to entertain an opinion with us, that the
bed of this river has greatly shifted its
situation; and that it once washed the hill
now a considerable distance to the east;
and that the ground on which Pittsburgh
now stands has been made by its withdrawing,
through time and accident, from that
hill to its present channel?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ohio</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This river commences at the junction
of the two above mentioned rivers, and
here also commences its beauty. It has
been described, as &lsquo;beyond all competition,
the most beautiful river in the universe,
whether we consider it for its meandering
course through an immense region of forests,
for its clean and elegant banks, which
afford innumerable delightful situations for
cities, villages and improved farms: or for
those many other advantages, which truly
entitle it to the name originally given it by
the French, of La Belle Rivi&egrave;re.&rsquo; This
description was penned several years since,
and it has not generally been thought an
exaggerated one. Now, the immense
forests recede, cultivation smiles along its
banks, towns every here and there decorate
its shores, and it is not extravagant to suppose
that the day is not far distant when
its whole margin will form one continued
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cramer further states that his reasons
for such a supposition are numerous.
Among those which he gives are: the large
tracts of fertile lands that are connected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>with the Ohio River by means of the navigable
waters that empty into it; the high,
dry and usually healthy river bottoms of
exceptional extent, fertility and beauty;
and the extraordinarily superior navigation
of the Ohio, by means of whose waters the
abundant products of these extensive and
fertile lands must eventually be distributed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At its commencement at Pittsburgh, it
takes a N.W. course for about 30 miles,
then turns gradually to W.S.W. and
pursuing that course for about 500 miles,
winds to the S.W. for nearly 160 miles,
then turns to the W. for about 276 miles,
then S.W. for 160 miles, and empties into
the Mississippi in a S.E. direction, about
1100 below Pittsburgh, and nearly the same
distance above New-Orleans, in lat. 36. 43
m. N. It is amazingly crooked, so much
so indeed, that in some places a person
taking observations of the sun or stars, will
find that he sometimes entirely changes his
direction, and appears to be going back
again; but its general course is S. 60 d. W.
Its general width is from 500 to 800 yards,
but at the rapids and near the mouth, it
is considerably wider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We can easily agree with Mr. Cramer
that the numerous islands, found in the
Ohio River, added greatly to its picturesque
grandeur; yet, he reminds us, they
caused many shoals and sandbars and
greatly embarrassed navigation. Some of
these islands contain several acres of rich
and fertile soil and, <i>The Navigator</i> tells us,
were covered with a luxuriant growth of
timber; when cleared and planted with
fruit trees the orchards thrived amazingly,
bearing the choicest fruit and the crop
seldom failing. This was also the case
when fruit trees were planted on the river
bottoms, the excellent crops, in both
instances, being due to the same cause: a
sandy, fertile soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In times of high freshes, vessels of
almost any tonnage may descend, and it is
never so low, but canoes and other light
crafts can navigate it. Many of the impediments
that are now met with while the water
is low, might in a dry time be got rid of,
and that at a very inconsiderable expense:
at least the expense would be by no means
inadequate to the advantages accruing from
the undertaking, if properly managed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rocks that now, during the dry season,
obstruct or render dangerous the navigation
of the large flat bottomed, or what are
called Kentucky boats, might be blown,
even a considerable depth under water;
channels might be made through the ripples,
and the snags and the fallen timber along
the banks entirely removed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These improvements together with
many others that might be enumerated
will undoubtedly, sooner or later, be carried
into effect, as they appear to be a national
concern of the first importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ohio has on its left in descending
a part of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky,
and the S. W. territory; on the right,
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana territory.
It receives in its course many large, navigable
streams, the principal ones are, Big
Beaver, Muskingum, Little and Great Kenhawa,
Sandy, Scioto, Little and Great
Miami, Licking, Kentucky, Salt, Green,
Wabash, Cumberland and Tennessee; these
will be more particularly mentioned in
their proper places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is of interest to note what Mr. Cramer
has to say of the fish of the Ohio River.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
He tells us they were numerous and of
various kinds: the catfish, weighing from
three to eighty pounds; the buffalo, from
five to thirty; the pike, from four to fifteen
pounds; the sturgeon, from four to ten;
the perch, from one to twenty-five; the
sucker, from one-half a pound to six
pounds; and occasionally a few herring
were caught. A fisherman, drawing in his
seine in the spring of 1805, found among
other fish, it is said, a few shad of three or
four pounds. These were caught at Pittsburg.
A great many felt disposed to
dispute that these were salt water shad
considering the great distance from the sea,
but all who tasted of them positively identified
them, in taste and shape, as the shad
which were caught in the Delaware River.
Eels and soft-shell turtles, though occasionally
caught, were not plentiful in 1806.
The numerous and various kinds of wild
ducks and the few geese which frequented
the river often furnished food for pioneers
descending the Ohio; for the purpose of
shooting ducks and geese, turkeys, and
occasionally a deer or bear, the boats were
always well supplied with fire-arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be glad could some method
be devised to ascertain annually the state
of the trade of our rivers&mdash;could not houses
for this purpose be established, say at
Pittsburg and Louisville, to take an account
of all cargoes that descend the Ohio? A
statement of this kind published yearly
would show the growing increase of our
exportations, and no doubt would be interesting
to the trading part of the community,
and perhaps have a tendency to rouse the
spirits of the more indolent and careless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the vast quantities of produce and
articles of our own manufacture that are
sent down this river, consisting of flour,
whiskey, peach brandy, cider, beer, bar-iron,
hollow-ware, earthern-ware, cabinet
works, boots, hoes, plow-irons, mill-irons,
chairs, biscuit, bread, cheese, bacon, beef,
pork, lumber, linen, &amp;c. &amp;c. we must not
forget to mention a part of the articles
which are brought up in return, viz. large
quantities of cotton, furs, peltries, lead
and hemp. As the articles of cotton and
lead can be brought up in this way much
cheaper than by bringing them over the
mountains, and as they are in great and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
constant demand in this country, we hope
that those concerned will use all due exertion
in pushing this part of our trade,
which in time we may presume will become
a very considerable object to those engaged
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Instructions&rdquo; in <i>The Navigator</i> to
emigrants afford a very clear idea of the
nature and needs of river travel in the first
half-decade of the eighteenth century: The
first thing to be attended to by emigrants
was to secure a boat, and be on the alert to
take advantage of the first flood. Mr.
Cramer speaks with emphatic indignation
concerning the dishonesty often manifested
by the builders of the river boats. He
asserts that a great per cent of the accidents
which happened on the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers were due either to
unpardonable carelessness or stinginess of
the builder, who either slighted his work
or used unfit timber. He earnestly recommends
the appointment of boat-inspectors
to be stationed wherever boats were built,
thereby avoiding many serious accidents
caused by unsafe boats. Mr. Cramer
attempts to impress upon all who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
purchasing Kentucky boats that those
intended for navigating the Mississippi
must necessarily be constructed differently
and of much stronger timber; he suggests
and urges that the owner have them narrowly
examined, before embarkation, by
one who understands the form and strength
of a boat suitable for navigating the Mississippi
River.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flat and Keel boats may be procured
at New-Geneva, Brownsville, Williamsport,
Elizabethtown, M&rsquo;Keesport, on the Monongahela,
and perhaps several places on the
Youghiougheny; at Pittsburgh, Beaver,
Charlestown, and Wheelen, Marietta, Limestone,
Cincinnati, the Falls, &amp;c. and at
most of the above places vessels of considerable
burden are built and freighted to
the Islands, and to different ports in Europe,
their principal cargoes consisting of flour,
staves, cordage, cotton, hemp, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spring and autumn were the two
seasons when the Ohio could be most
advantageously navigated. The spring
season began at the breaking up of the ice,
about the middle of February, and lasted
for three months. The fall season gener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ally
began in October and lasted until the
advent of winter, or about the first of
December. At this time the forming ice
prevented navigation. These spring and
fall freshets, however, could not be called
periodical, as they entirely depended upon
the rainfall and the earliness or tardiness
of the beginning and ending of winter.
Nor were these seasons of high water
entirely confined to the spring and autumn.
It commonly occurred that in the summer
season a heavy rainfall in the Appalachian
ridges, where the creeks and rivers that
flow into the Monongahela take their rise,
would cause a considerable freshet in the
Ohio; or a swelling of the current of the
Allegheny and other rivers often happened
in the summer months and occasioned a
sufficient amount of water, if taken immediate
advantage of, to render the navigation
of the Ohio perfectly possible. These
out-of-season freshets, however, subsided
rapidly and if the owner of a boat wished
to take advantage of one and go down
the river, he had to embark immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When provided with a good boat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
strong cable of at least 40 feet long there
is little danger in descending the river in
high freshes, when proper care is taken,
unless at such times as when there is much
floating ice in it. Much exertion with the
oars is, at such times, generally speaking
of no manner of use; indeed it is rather
detrimental than otherwise, as such exertion
frequently throws you out of the current
which you ought to continue in, as it will
carry you along with more rapidity, and at
the same time always takes you right. By
trusting to the current there is no danger
to be feared in passing the islands as it will
carry you past them in safety. On the
other hand, if you row, and by so doing
happen to be in the middle of the river on
approaching an island, there is great danger
of being thrown on the upper point of it
before you are aware, or have time to
regain the current. In case you get aground
in such a situation, become entangled
among the aquatic timber, which is generally
abundant, or are driven by the force
of the water among the tops or trunks of
other trees, you may consider yourself in
imminent danger; nothing but the presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of mind and great exertion can extricate
you from this dilemma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As frequent landing is attended with
considerable loss of time and some hazard,
you should contrive to land as seldom as
possible, you need not even lie by at night,
provided you trust to the current, and keep
a good look out; if you have a moon, so
much the better. When you bring to, the
strength of your cable is a great safe-guard.
A quantity of fuel and other necessaries,
should be laid in at once, and every boat
ought to have a canoe along side, to send
on shore when necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though the labour of navigating this
river in times of fresh is very inconsiderable
to what it is during low water, when continual
rowing is necessary, it is always best
to keep a good look out, and be strong
handed.&mdash;The wind will sometimes drive
you too near the points of the islands, or
on projecting parts of the main shore, when
considerable extra exertion is necessary to
surmount the difficulty. You will frequently
meet with head winds, as the river
is so very crooked that what is in your
favour one hour, will probably be directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
against you the next, and when contrary
winds contend with a strong current, it is
attended with considerable inconvenience,
and requires careful and circumspect management,
or you may be driven on shore
in spite of all your efforts. One favourable
circumstance is, that the wind commonly
abates about sunset, particularly in summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boats have frequently passed from
Pittsburgh to the mouth of Ohio in 15 days,
but in general 10 days from Pittsburgh to
the falls is reckoned a quick passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Descending the river when much incommoded
with floating ice, should be as much
as possible avoided, particularly early in
the winter, as there is a great probability
of its stopping your boat; however, if the
water is high, and there is an appearance
of open weather, you may venture with
some propriety, if the cakes are not so
heavy as to impede your progress, or injure
your timbers; the boat will in such case,
make more way than the ice, a great deal
of which will sink and get thinner as it
progresses, but on the other hand, if the
water is low, it is by no means safe to em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>bark
on it when anything considerable of
ice is in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If at any time you are obliged to bring
to on account of the ice, great circumspection
should be used in the choice of a place
to lie in; there are many places where the
shore projecting to a point, throws off the
cakes of ice towards the middle of the river,
and forms a kind of harbour below. By
bringing to in such a situation, and fixing
your canoe above the boat, with one end
strongly to the shore, and the other out in
the stream sloping down the river, so as to
drive out such masses of ice as would
otherwise accumulate on the upper side of
your boat, and tend to sink her and drive
her from her moorings, you may lie with a
tolerable degree of safety.&mdash;This is a much
better method than that of felling a tree on
the shore above, so as to fall partly into the
river, for if in felling it, it does not adhere
in some measure to the trunk, or rest sufficiently
on the bank, the weight of accumulated
ice will be apt to send it adrift, and
bring it down, ice and all, on the boat,
when no safety can be expected for it.
The reflection here naturally occurs, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
easy it would be, and how little it would
cost, in different places on the river where
boats are accustomed to land, to project a
sort of pier into the river, which inclining
down stream, would at all times insure a
place of safety below it. The advantages
accruing from such projection to the places
where they might be made would be very
considerable, bring them into repute as
landing places, occasion many boats and
passengers to stop there, who otherwise
would not, and soon repay the trifling
expense incurred by the erection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The above observations are more
particularly applicable to the Ohio; the
following apply to the Mississippi, and point
out the greatest impediments and the most
imminent dangers attending the navigation
of this heavy-watered and powerful river:</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are, 1st. The instability of the
banks.</p>

<p>2. Planters, sawyers, and wooden islands.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall endeavor to instruct the
unexperienced navigator how to avoid
them. The instability of the banks proceeds
from their being composed of a loose
sandy soil, and the impetuosity of the
current against their prominent parts,
which, by undermining them unceasingly,
causes them to tumble into the river, taking
with them everything that may be above.
And if when the event happens boats
should be moored there, they must necessarily
be buried in the common ruin, which
unfortunately has been sometimes the case.
For which reason, navigators have made it
an invariable rule never to land at or near
a point, but always in the sinuosity or cove
below it, which is generally lined with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
small willows of the weeping kind, whence
some call them although improperly, willow
points, and which being generally clear
of logs and planters, the landing is easily
effected, by running directly into them,
the resistance of the willows destroying a
part of the boat&rsquo;s velosity, and the rest is
overcome without much exertion by holding
fast to the limbs which surround you.&mdash;In
those places the river generally deposits
the surplus of soil, with which it is charged
from the continual cavings of the points,
and so forms new land on one side by
destroying some on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The banks of this river from where it
receives the Missouri to its mouth, being
with a few exceptions below high water
mark, an immense country is inundated,
when the river is in its highest state, by
which those extensive swamps are formed
and supplied, which prove the nurseries of
myriades of musquitoes and other insects
(to the no small inconvenience of the traveller)
and the never failing source of
grievous diseases to the inhabitants. There
are also streams, which at all times sally
forth from the main river with astonishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
rapidity, and whose vortex extends some
distance into the stream. Boats once sucked
into such bayous are next to lost, it being
almost impossible to force so unwieldy a
machine as a flat bottomed boat against so
powerful a current. It will therefore be
safest for boats, never to keep too close to
shore, but to keep some distance out in the
river. To avoid planters and sawyers
requires nothing more but attention, for
they always occasion a small breaker whereever
they are, and if your boat seems to be
hurried towards them row the boat from
them, else if you are dilatory you must
abide by the consequence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Wooden-Islands</span> are more dangerous
than real ones the former being an obstacle
lately thrown in the way of the current,
and the bed of the river not having had
sufficient time to form that bar or gradual
ascent from the bottom of the river to the
island, which divides the current at some
distance from the point of the island above
water, the current will hurry you against
them, unless you use timely exertion.
From all this it must be evident how imprudent
it is attempting to go after night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
even when assisted by a clear moon; but
after you are once arrived at Natchez, you
may safely proceed day and night, the river
from that place to its mouth being clear,
and opposing nothing to your progress but
a few eddies into which you may occasionally
be drawn and detained for a short
time.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF RIVER CRAFT</h3>


<p>The evolution of craft on the Ohio
River portrays in a remarkable manner
the economic development of
the Central West. Being the one practicable
artery in the empire between the
Appalachian uplift and the Mississippi, and
the Blue Ridge and the Great Lakes, this
river was, from the beginning of the eighteenth
century onward, the main route of
immigration and commerce, and the story
of those years is contained in the story of
these craft which carried the freight and
fortune of the millions who came and built
homes and labored here.</p>

<p>The greater the detail with which this
study is examined the more interesting and
enlightening it becomes. Of the score and
more of distinctive craft which regularly
plied this waterway not one but is significant
of some change in the social order of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
things, indicative of some open or secret
development which, unnoticed at the time
perhaps, marked a new forward movement
in our social evolution. Such an indication
may be thought slight but it was a straw
which marked the direction of the sweeping
current of advance, and the swiftness of it.
Compared with the evolution of methods
of travel by land, the evolution on our
rivers was rapid and spectacular. The
&ldquo;freighter&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conestoga&rdquo; of 1790 was
practically the same as that of 1840: a half
century had witnessed little change in
wagons and stages, save minor improvements.
But compare the craft of 1790 on
the Ohio with that of 1840. The canoe,
pirogue, keel-boat, &ldquo;bark,&rdquo; barge, brig,
schooner, galley-boat, batteau, and dug-out
were forgotten&mdash;a consequence of the
early application of steam-power to boats
rather than to vehicles. When, in 1811,
&ldquo;The Orleans&rdquo; went steaming down the
Ohio from Pittsburg, and when, six years
later, the &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; convinced a
desparing public that steamboat navigation
would succeed on &ldquo;western waters&rdquo; the
new era in western history dawned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>In the earliest days the primitive light
canoe, the unwieldy pirogue, and the heavy
batteau were the common means of navigation
on the Ohio. The canoe was made
from the bark of trees; quickly made and
quickly worn out, if the water was low, by
continually coming in contact with the bottom.
The pirogue was likewise quickly
made; the canoe was paddled, the pirogue
pushed by oars or setting-poles. The canoe
easily glided up stream; the pirogue ran
easily with the current but could not ascend
the stream without the expenditure of
much labor. Often the words canoe and
pirogue were used interchangeably of the
same craft; in George Rogers Clark&rsquo;s
famous march to Vincennes in 1779, the
army, upon arriving at the Little Wabash,
February 13, built a boat which in Bowman&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i> is called a &ldquo;canoe,&rdquo; and in
Clark&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>, a &ldquo;pirogue.&rdquo; The batteau,
better known in the West as the barge,
was a square box of any length, width, and
depth. It was distinctively a downstream
craft, and in the early days rarely ascended
with a load any river of current. The
canoe and pirogue, compared with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
barge, were craft of little burden though
those of generous size would carry the
loads of a score of men. The barge or
batteau was the freight craft and could be
loaded with any burden the stage of water
permitted.</p>

<p>These three craft reigned supreme on
the Ohio and its tributaries probably until
the close of the Revolutionary War, or
about 1785. The canoe never abdicated and
never can so long as man loves the water;
at numerous points along the Ohio today
many a tourist may be seen enjoying the
exquisite delight of &ldquo;paddling his own
canoe.&rdquo; The batteau or barge has its
direct descendant in the wooden and magnificent
steel barges in which thousands of
tons of coal and ore are transported yearly
up and down the Ohio. The pirogue has
been forgotten. But in the era of exploration
and conquest these boats had a story
which disproves the adage that history
repeats itself. The history of that last
half of the eighteenth century cannot be
repeated here or elsewhere. There is no
other valley in the world that is to be
found, explored, conquered, reconquered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and settled like the Ohio Basin. What a
line of daring <i>voyageurs</i> that was from La
Salle to C&eacute;loron and Washington, who
feasted their eyes upon the virgin beauty
of La Belle Rivi&egrave;re, from their heavily-loaded,
long canoes; in these craft came
the explorers of Ohio and Kentucky, Indiana
and Illinois; they ploughed the waters
of the Muskingum far back in the distant
day when those waters were, as the name
implies, clear as an elk&rsquo;s eye; they forged
slowly up the Licking and Scioto, the
Beaver and the Kanawhas. In the early
days the canoe was the customary bearer
of two significant kinds of freight: wampum
and Indian goods and presents, and packs
of peltry. The history of the canoe cannot
be repeated, for the Indians are vanished
who loved the bright presents brought to
them from the East; and the fur bearing
animals which once supplied the eastern
markets are gone. We speak of the value
of our cargoes on the Ohio today; it is
great, truly; but what would be the value
today of the furs brought in one season
down the Wabash, Licking, Miami, Scioto,
Kanawha, Muskingum, and Beaver and up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the Ohio to Pittsburg, in those days when
canoes bore their precious tons of freight?
Compared to the number of persons engaged
in it, the old trade (in today&rsquo;s markets)
would be considered a hundred per cent
more remunerative.</p>

<p>The burdens those long canoes could bear
should not be underestimated. When
Washington made his journey down the
Ohio in 1770 he &ldquo;embarked in a large
canoe,&rdquo; October 20, at Pittsburg, &ldquo;with
sufficient store of provisions and necessaries,
and the following persons, besides Dr.
Craik and myself, to wit: Capt. Crawford,
Joseph Nicholson, Robert Bell, William
Harrison, Charles Morgan and Daniel Rendon,
a boy of Capt. Crawford&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the era of conquest the canoe played
an important part in transporting small
bodies of men swiftly and, which was frequently
not less important, silently, to their
destinations. But now it was that the
heavy barge acquired importance as a factor
in the making of the West. It was the
quarter-master&rsquo;s and commissariat&rsquo;s sole
reliance, and in these great clumsy hulks
which floated with the current, sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
with the aid of sails, were transported the
armament and stores which made possible
the forts that at once came into existence
in the valley&mdash;Forts Mclntosh, Henry,
Harmar, Finney, Washington, and others.
These boats were huge boxes, covered and
uncovered, square at each end, and flat-bottomed.
A batteau, in distinction from a
barge, was widest in the middle and tapered
to a point at each end, of about fifteen hundred-weight
burden and could be managed
by two men with oars and setting-poles.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The batteau form was more or less
adopted by later barges; but the ordinary
early barge was much the shape of the
present-day coal barge. The &ldquo;canal boat&rdquo;
form, or batteau, was a later development.</p>

<p>American expansion westward, as elsewhere
suggested, was favored more by the
Ohio River than by any and all others: it
ran the right way. Throughout the earlier
decades of the pioneer era the greater portion
of traffic was down stream. Even in
the later days of steamboating the downstream
traffic was ever heaviest. In 1835
the total tonnage received and entered at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the port of Pittsburg was 63,221 tons; of
this, 41,533 tons was export. In 1837 the
total number of boats arriving at Pittsburg
from February 10 to July 1 was five hundred
and ninety-three; the total number
departing was five hundred and eighty-two.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
If the upstream trade did not equal
the downstream trade in the days of steamboats,
it can be readily imagined how great
was the difference in the days of rowed
and pushed craft. Upstream traffic began
to thrive with the founding of Pittsburg
and other cities in the upper Ohio Valley.
A market was then created, and the product
of the lower valley began to ascend.</p>

<p>Thus dawned the era of the famous keel-boat,
the first craft of burden that plied to
and fro on western waters. True, the name
was applied to craft that came earlier.
Colonel Burd, the English officer who led
one of the marauding expeditions from
Detroit into Kentucky in the Revolutionary
War, came from the lakes and ascended the
Licking in keel-boats. It is given on good
authority that Tarascon, Berthoud and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Company of Pittsburg introduced the use
of keel-boats on the Ohio in 1792.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The keel-boat heralded a new era in
internal development, an era of internal
communication never known before in the
Central West. As a craft it is almost forgotten
today. Our oldest citizens can barely
remember the last years of its reign; but
the cry of the steersman to &ldquo;lift&rdquo; and
&ldquo;set&rdquo; that once rang in our river valleys,
is still one of the undying memories of their
childhood days. It was a long, narrow
craft perhaps averaging twelve to fifteen
feet by fifty, and pointed at both prow and
stern. On either side were provided what
were known as &ldquo;running boards,&rdquo; extending
from end to end. The space between,
the body of the boat, was enclosed and
roofed over with boards or shingles. A
keel-boat would carry from twenty to forty
tons of freight well protected from the
weather; it required from six to ten
men, in addition to the captain, who was
usually the steersman, to propel it upstream.
Each man was provided with a
pole to which was affixed a heavy socket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
The crew, being divided equally on each
side of the boat, &ldquo;set&rdquo; their poles at the
head of the boat; then bringing the end of
the pole to the shoulder, with bodies bent,
they walked slowly along the running
boards to the stern&mdash;returning quickly, at
the command of the captain, to the head
for a new &ldquo;set.&rdquo; &ldquo;In ascending rapids,
the greatest effort of the whole crew was
required, so that only one at a time could
&lsquo;shift&rsquo; his pole. This ascending of rapids
was attended with great danger, especially
if the channel was rocky. The slightest
error in pushing or steering the boat exposed
her to be thrown across the current,
and to be brought sideways in contact with
rocks which would mean her destruction.
Or, if she escaped injury, a crew who had
let their boat swing in the rapids would
have lost caste. A boatman who could not
boast that he had never swung or backed in
a chute was regarded with contempt, and
never trusted with the head pole, the place
of honor among the keel-boat men. It
required much practice to become a first
rate boatman, and none would be taken,
even on trial, who did not possess great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
muscular power.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Under certain circumstances
it was serviceable to catch hold of
the bushes and trees on a river&rsquo;s bank and
pull a keel-boat upstream; this was commonly
known as &ldquo;bushwhacking&rdquo; and
was particularly useful in times of high
water. The number of keel-boats on the
Ohio was not as large, probably, as would
be supposed. It is on record that from
November 24, 1810 to January 24, 1811&mdash;two
winter months&mdash;twenty-four of these
craft descended the &ldquo;falls&rdquo; of the Ohio
at Louisville. It is probable that at this
time there were not over three or four
hundred keel-boats regularly plying the
Ohio and its tributaries.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the keel-boat, it will
be noted, permitted it to ply far up the
larger tributaries of the Ohio and to a considerable
way up its smaller tributaries&mdash;territory
which the barge and flat-boat
could never reach. It is probable, therefore,
that the keel-boat brought much territory
into touch with the world that otherwise
was never reached save by the heavy
freighter and the pack-saddle; indeed it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
probable that this was the greatest service of
the keel-boat&mdash;to reach the rich interior
settlements and carry their imports and
exports. The place of the keel-boat is now
taken by such packets as the Greenwood
and Lorena which bring to Pittsburg the
produce of such valleys as the Kanawha
and the Muskingum. In this connection
it is proper to emphasize a fact suggested
elsewhere: that the inhabitants of the Central
West, from the earliest times until
today, have found the favorite sites of
occupation to be in the interior of the country,
beside the lesser tributaries of the
Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Thus as the pioneer settlements
spread up on the Licking, Muskingum,
Hockhocking, Scioto, and Miami, a boat
like the keel-boat, which could ply in any
season of the year and on the narrow creeks
and &ldquo;runs,&rdquo; was an inestimable boon.
Again, take for instance the salt industry,
which in the day of the keel-boat was one
of the most important, if not the most important,
in the Central West; as values
were a century ago the best of men did
well to &ldquo;earn his salt.&rdquo; These salt springs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
and licks were found at some distance from
the main artery of travel, the Ohio, and it
was the keel-boat, more enduring than the
canoe, and of lighter weight and draught
and of lesser width than the barge, which
did the greater part of the salt distribution,
returning usually with loads of flour. The
heyday of the keel-boat was also the day of
the portage path&mdash;which played a most
important part in the development of the
land. These portages or carries were
mostly located far in the interior where
rivers flowing in opposite directions took
their rise. The keel-boat was the only
craft of burden that could ascend many of
our streams to the carrying-place; they
were also less unwieldy to carry than the
old batteau which was used also in the
portage carrying-trade.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Mention has been
made of Burd&rsquo;s invasion of Kentucky during
the Revolutionary War, in keel-boats.
If this was not a misnomer it is probable
that they were brought from the lakes and
carried across the portage, as was done in
the case of Hamilton&rsquo;s capture of Vincennes.</p>

<p>The keel-boat may be considered, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>fore,
the first upstream boat of burden
which plied the Ohio and its tributaries;
its special functions: first, the upstream
trade, second, to touch and connect interior
settlements and do the carrying-trade of
the portages.</p>

<p>The great craft of burden on the Ohio
and its larger tributaries were the barges
and the flat-boats, the latter commonly
known as the Kentucky &ldquo;broad-horns&rdquo; or
Kentucky boats, and New Orleans boats.
The Ohio and Mississippi barge resembled
the &ldquo;West Country&rdquo; barges of England
and the &ldquo;wherries&rdquo; of London. They
were great, pointed, covered hulks carrying
forty or fifty tons of freight and manned by
almost as many men. They were the great
freighters of the larger rivers, descending
with the current and ascending by means
of oars, poles, sails and cordelles&mdash;ropes by
which the craft was often towed from the
shore. The following description of a
barge journey, from the pen of the famous
naturalist Audubon, is perhaps one of the
most accurate left to us:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall suppose one of these boats
under way, and, having passed Natchez,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
entering upon what were called the difficulties
of their ascent. Wherever a point
projected so as to render the course or bend
below it of some magnitude, there was an
eddy, the returning current of which was
sometimes as strong as that of the middle of
the great stream. The bargemen, therefore,
rowed up pretty close under the bank,
and had merely to keep watch in the bow
lest the boat should run against a planter
or sawyer. But the boat has reached the
point, and there the current is to all appearance
of double strength and right
against it. The men, who have rested a
few minutes, are ordered to take their stations
and lay hold of their oars, for the
river must be crossed, it being seldom possible
to double such a point and proceed
along the same shore. The boat is crossing,
its head slanting to the current, which
is, however, too strong for the rowers, and
when the other side of the river has been
reached, it has drifted perhaps a quarter of
a mile. The men are by this time exhausted,
and, as we shall suppose it to be
12 o&rsquo;clock, fasten the boat to a tree on the
shore. A small glass of whiskey is given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to each, when they cook and eat their dinner,
and after resting from their fatigue
for an hour, recommence their labors. The
boat is again seen slowly advancing against
the stream. It has reached the lower end
of a sandbar, along the edge of which it is
propelled by means of long poles, if the
bottom be hard. Two men, called bowsmen,
remain at the prow to assist, in concert
with the steersman, in managing the
boat and keeping its head right against the
current. The rest place themselves on the
land side of the footway of the vessel, put
one end of their poles on the ground and
the other against their shoulders and push
with all their might. As each of the men
reaches the stern, he crosses to the other
side, runs along it and comes again to the
landward side of the bow, when he recommences
operations. The barge in the meantime
is ascending at a rate not exceeding
one mile in the hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bar is at length passed, and as the
shore in sight is straight on both sides and
the current uniformly strong, the poles are
laid aside, and the men being equally
divided, those on the river side take to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
their oars, while those on the land-side lay
hold of the branches of willows or other
trees, and thus slowly propel the boat.
Here and there, however, the trunk of a
fallen tree, partly lying on the bank and
partly projecting beyond it, impedes their
progress and requires to be doubled. This
is performed by striking into it the iron
points of the poles and gaff-hooks, and so
pulling around it. The sun is now quite
low, and the barge is again secured in the
best harbor within reach for the night,
after having accomplished a distance of
perhaps fifteen miles. The next day the
wind proves favorable, the sail is set, the
boat takes all advantages, and meeting with
no accident, has ascended thirty miles&mdash;perhaps
double that distance. The next
day comes with a very different aspect.
The wind is right ahead, the shores are
without trees of any kind, and the canes on
the bank are so thick and stout that not
even the cordelles can be used. This occasions
a halt. The time is not altogether
lost, as most of the men, being provided
with rifles, betake themselves to the woods
and search for the deer, the hares or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
turkeys that are generally abundant there.
Three days may pass before the wind
changes, and the advantages gained on the
previous five days are forgotten. Again
the boat proceeds, but in passing over a
shallow place, runs on a log, swings with
the current, but hangs fast with her lee-side
almost under water. Now for the
poles! All hands are on deck, bustling and
pushing. At length, towards sunset, the
boat is once more afloat, and is again taken
to the shore where the wearied crew pass
another night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could tell you of the crew abandoning
the boat and cargo and of numberless accidents
and perils, but be it enough to say,
that advancing in this tardy manner, the
boat that left New Orleans on the 1st of
March, often did not reach the Falls of
Ohio [Louisville] until the month of July,
sometimes not until October; and after all
this immense trouble, it brought only a few
bags of coffee and at most one hundred
hogsheads of sugar. Such was the state
of things as late as 1808. The number of
barges at that period did not amount to
more than 25 or 30, and the largest prob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ably
did not exceed one hundred tons burden.
To make the best of this fatiguing
navigation, I may conclude by saying that
a barge which came up in three months,
had done wonders, for I believe few voyages
were performed in that time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>This is the story of an Orleans boat in
distinction from a Kentucky boat which
was smaller and not so well finished.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The heavy up-river loads of the Orleans
boats&mdash;sugar and molasses&mdash;were very
important cargoes and illustrate the place
the barge took in pioneer history; they
were the freighters which carried on the
larger rivers the heavy cargoes of a country
fast filling with a new population. They
plied, like the keel-boat, up and down
stream but could not ascend the smaller
rivers or reach portages of the larger
streams because of their draught and size.
There were, of course, small barges that
could go wherever a keel-boat went; it was
these that were common on certain portage
path trades.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The small barge was prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>tically
a keel-boat (without running boards)
save only in shape.</p>

<p>The flat-boat was the important craft of
the era of immigration, the friend of the
pioneer. It was the boat that never came
back, a downstream craft solely. The flat-boat
of average size was a roofed craft
about forty feet long, twelve feet wide and
eight feet deep. It was square and flat-bottomed
and was managed by six oars;
two of these, about thirty feet long, on
each side, were known as &ldquo;sweeps&rdquo; and
were manned by two men each; one at the
stern, forty or fifty feet long including its
big blade, was called the &ldquo;steering oar;&rdquo;
a small oar was located at the prow, known
as the &ldquo;gouger,&rdquo; which aided in steering
the boat in swift water. One man only
was needed at the steering oar and at the
gouger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kentucky&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Orleans&rdquo; were
the significant names for the old-time flat-boats,
for Kentucky and New Orleans were
the destinations of the large majority. The
nominal difference between a Kentucky
and New Orleans boat was that the former
was commonly roofed only half over while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the latter was stronger and was entirely
covered with a roof. How to buy or build
a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; was the first query of the pioneer
father as he finally arrived at one of the
ports on the upper Ohio. Often several
families joined together and came down
the river on one flat-boat, a motley congregation
of men, women, children and domestic
animals surrounded by the few crude,
housekeeping utensils which had been
brought over the mountains or purchased
at the port of embarkation. Perhaps all
of the details which engrossed a prospective
pioneer&rsquo;s attention are suggested
in the previous quotations from <i>The Navigator</i>.</p>

<p>These Kentucky &ldquo;broadhorns,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;broadhorn flatboats&rdquo; as they were also
called, almost invariably carried a tin horn
by means of which some one on board would
announce their arrival or make known their
whereabouts in a fog. This weird music,
reverberating from hill to hill, was heard
far and wide and was welcomed by the
country people.</p>

<p>The history of the flat-boat comes down
within the present generation, for as late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
as the beginning of the Civil War flat-boating
was common on the Ohio River. In
the early day the flat-boat was the sign of
immigration; not so in the later day.
The flat-boats of the fifties bore cargoes to
the southern ports, or cargoes to be retailed
along the Mississippi River plantations.
Any enterprising man who owned or could
build a &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; bought up the crops of his
neighborhood, put them aboard, and was
ready to start on the &ldquo;fall rise.&rdquo; Flat-boats
were loaded at the bow&mdash;sometimes
through trapdoors in the roof&mdash;the cargo
stored away in the hold. For through
freight, apples and potatoes were the
staples. If it was intended to &ldquo;coast&rdquo;
(peddle the cargo to the plantations) the
freight also included cider, cheese, pork,
bacon, and even cabbage. Apple and peach
brandy was a most profitable investment;
especially if apple brandy, with a few
peaches in it, could be palmed off on the
thirsty darkies as peach brandy.</p>

<p>A yellow page of an old account-book of
1858 leaves record that the proprietor of
one &ldquo;flat&rdquo; purchased the entire product of
a neighboring farm and took it south that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
fall. The items and their cost price on
shore is interesting:</p>

<p>A yearly cash income of $1,230.79 would
make many a farmer of our day contented.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the flat-boat left on his
three thousand mile trip taking only a
couple of farm hands with him as crew.
They lived in the stern of the boat under
the same roof that sheltered the cargo, but
separated by a partition. It was all clear
sailing, night and day. Almost the only
work was to keep the craft in the current.
Several miles above the &ldquo;falls&rdquo; at Louisville,
pilots would be found in skiffs ready
to climb aboard and steer the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; down
the rapids for ten dollars or less. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
cargo was intended for the coasting trade,
business began at the first large plantations.
This was in the day of overseers who liberally
patronized these &ldquo;coasters,&rdquo; giving in
payment drafts on New Orleans. The
darkies were, in some cases, allowed to
make their own purchases; they did not
neglect the liquor, often exchanging molasses
for brandy even, gallon for gallon.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at his destination, the
proprietor sold his remaining stock and
boat, invested his money in sugar and
molasses, and embarked with his freight
on a packet for home. Thus two profits
were cleared.</p>

<p>The advent of the Civil War was evident
to these latter day boatmen; watches were
always kept on the outlook lest the &ldquo;lines&rdquo;
be cut. At the opening of the war flat-boats
were frequently fired upon. When
the business was again revived in 1866 it
was a new, sad South the flat-boat men
found. The negroes were &ldquo;free,&rdquo; the
overseers gone, the coasting trade ruined;
through freights were found to be the only
ones that paid after 1865.</p>

<p>Collins asserts that Captain Jacob Yoder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
took the first flat-boat down the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans in 1782;
&ldquo;the late Capt. Jos. Pierce of Cincinnati,
Ohio, had erected over the remains of his
old friend Capt. Jacob Yoder, an iron tablet
(the first cast west of the Alleghanies) thus
inscribed:</p>


<p class="center">&lsquo;JACOB YODER</p>

<p class="noidt">Was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, August
11, 1758; and was | a soldier of the Revolutionary
army in 1777 and 1778. | He emigrated
to the West in 1780; and in May,
1782, from Fort Redstone, | on the Monongahela
river, in the | <span class="smcap">First Flat Boat</span>. |
That ever descended the Mississippi river,
he landed in | New Orleans, with a cargoe
of produce. | He died April 7, 1832, at his
farm in Spencer County, Kentucky, and lies
| here interred beneath this tablet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flat-boats were, both in early and modern
times, always used or sold at their
destination for lumber. Thus the early
bargemen and flat-boat men who made
down river trips returned largely on foot,
until the era of steamboats. The long
journey across country from New Orleans
through the low fever-infested country and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
into Kentucky was a dangerous and arduous
experience.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> &ldquo;A large number of these
boatmen were brought together at New
Orleans. Their journey home could not
be made in small parties, as they carried
large quantities of specie, and the road was
infested by robbers. The outlaws and
fugitives from justice from the states
resorted to this road. Some precautionary
arrangements were necessary. The boatmen
who preferred returning through the
wilderness organized and selected their
officers. These companies sometimes numbered
several hundred, and a greater proportion
of them were armed. They were
provided with mules to carry the specie
and provisions, and some spare ones for
the sick. Those who were able purchased
mules, or Indian ponies, for their use, but
few could afford to ride. As the journey
was usually performed after the sickly season
commenced, and the first six or seven
hundred miles was through a flat, unhealthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
country, with bad water, the spare mules
were early loaded with the sick. There
was a general anxiety to hasten through
this region of malaria. Officers would give
up their horses to the sick, companions
would carry them forward as long as their
strength enabled; but although everything
was done for their relief which could be
done without retarding the progress of their
journey, many died on the way or were
left to the care of the Indian or hunter who
settled on the road. Many who survived
an attack of fever, and reached the healthy
country of Tennessee, were long recovering
sufficient strength to resume their journey
home. One would suppose that men would
have been reluctant to engage in a service
which exposed them to such great suffering
and mortality without extraordinary compensation;
but such was the love of adventure
and recklessness of danger which
characterized the young men of the West,
that there was no lack of hands to man the
boats, although their number increased
from twenty-five to fifty per cent yearly.
The fact that some of these boatmen would
return with fifty Spanish dollars, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was a large sum at that day, was no small
incentive to others, who perhaps never had
a dollar of their own.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;ark&rdquo; of pioneer days was, as the
name implies, the earliest type of houseboat.
&ldquo;These boats,&rdquo; Mr. Harris records,
&ldquo;are generally called &lsquo;Arks;&rsquo; and are said
to have been invented by Mr. Krudger, on
the Juniata, about ten years ago [1795].
They are square, and flat-bottomed; about
forty feet by fifteen, with sides six feet
deep; covered with a roof of thin boards;
and accommodated with a fire-place. They
require but four hands to navigate them,
carry no sail, and are wafted down by the
current.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Rafting logs down the Ohio was one of
the great employments of the men of three-quarters
of a century ago. &ldquo;Our raft,&rdquo;
testified an old <i>voyageur</i> who went down the
Allegheny and Ohio from Olean, New
York in 1821, &ldquo;was one hundred and twenty
feet long and sixty wide and about two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
feet deep. It had eight oars. In the center
was our cabin, which was twenty by
sixteen, and contained, of course, our provisions
and valuables, ... and our <i>stove</i>.
This was a patent range peculiar to those
days and quite wonderful in its way. It
was made of a wooden box lined with clay.
It had a hole in the top for a kettle, and
another through which the smoke passed
to an aperture in the roof of our cabin, left
for that purpose.... Our crew consisted
of ten persons, including a man and his
wife and one child, who were going to
migrate.... There are many eddies
along the river and at them we tried to tie
up at night in order to be out of the current....
From Pittsburg to Cincinnati,
five hundred miles, the river being broad
and deep and free from snags, we could
travel night and day.... At one point
in our trip we saw a raft stranded on an
island; but the Captain did not seem to
take the matter very seriously to heart, and
answered our salutations by singing and
dancing and lustily waving his hat as we
passed by.... At Limestone, [Maysville]
Ky., seventy miles east of Cincinnati,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
I stopped and sold some shingles, the raft
and the rest of the crew going on. After
I had transacted my business, I took passage
on another going to C. [Cincinnati]. At
L. [Limestone] I remember seeing a bell
on a tavern for the first time. This raft
had the misfortune to run into a flatboat
loaded with coal, and also the audacity to
sneak off before the damage was discovered
to avoid both delay and expense....
Once there [at Cincinnati] we hired a gang
of men to wash the lumber, which was
covered with dirt and weeds; they then
drew it to the lumber yard, where we sold
it.... I was not sorry when I reached
my home ... on the evening of the 10th
of June. I had been away since the middle
of February.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The galley&mdash;a model boat with covered
deck impelled by oarsmen&mdash;was not an
unfamiliar craft in the early river days. It
was such a boat as this that General George
Rogers Clark armed as a gunboat on the
lower Ohio and used as a patrolling gunboat
during the Revolutionary War. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
famed &ldquo;Adventure Galley,&rdquo; of the New
England pilgrims to Marietta, was a craft
of this pattern. It was forty-five feet long
and twelve feet wide, with an estimated
burden of fifty tons. Her bows were raking
or curved, strongly built with heavy timbers
and covered with a deck roof.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is
probable that the first mail boats which ran
on the Ohio in 1793 were of similar design.
This service, established by Jacob Myers
between Cincinnati and Pittsburg, was
advertised on November 16 as leaving Cincinnati
at 8 A. M. every alternate Saturday,
requiring one month for the round trip.
The proprietor took great credit to himself,
&ldquo;claiming to be &lsquo;influenced by love of
philanthropy and desire of being serviceable
to the public.&rsquo; He further stated: &lsquo;No
danger need be apprehended from the
[Indian] enemy, as every person on board
will be under cover, made proof against rifle
or musquet balls, and port holes for firing
out of. Each boat is armed with six pieces
carrying a pound ball; also a number of
good musquets, and amply supplied with
ammunition, strongly manned with choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
hands, and the masters of approved knowledge.
A separate cabin is partitioned off
for accommodating ladies on their passage;
conveniences are constructed so as to render
landing unnecessary, as it might, at times,
be attended with danger. Rules and regulations
for maintaining order and for the
good management of the boats, and tables
of the rates of freightage, passage, and
carrying of letters; also, of the exact time
of arrival and departure at all way places,
may be seen on the boat and at the printing
office in Cincinnati. Passengers supplied
with provisions and liquors, of first quality,
at most reasonable rates possible. Persons
may work their passage. An office for
insuring at moderate rates the property
carried, will be kept at Cincinnati, Limestone,
(i. e. Maysville) and Pittsburgh.&rsquo;
Packet-boat promises then, like steamboat
promises nowadays, were not <i>always</i> kept;
instead of on November 30th, the second
boat did not leave until December 10th,
&lsquo;precisely at 10 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In the days before steamboats, sails
were greatly used on almost every manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of craft, and were made of every conceivable
material. The great barges of early
days were moved by sails when the wind
was favorable.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Both barges and keel-boats
were &ldquo;provided with a mast, a square
sail....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Canoes were frequently provided
with sails and their progress was
more or less dependent on the winds.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The story of the building of the first
brigs and schooners on the Ohio and its
tributaries, the dreams of their proprietors
and masters, and the experiences of their
crews, is a subject worthy of a volume.
The building of these larger craft for the
Mississippi and ocean trade suggests at the
outset the long, conflicting story of Mississippi
control which can only be hinted
at here.</p>

<p>This business of building sailing vessels
in the Ohio Basin began the decade before
the nineteenth century opened, and grew
more and more important until steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
navigation revolutionized the river trade.
These brigs and schooners were, without
doubt, distinctively down river craft, which
never returned; they were therefore the
export carriers, and the importance of their
place in history may be found in the fact
that their appearance marks the rise of the
export business to a position of prominence,
as the use of the keel-boat marked
the rise of what may be called interstate
commerce.</p>

<p>In the year 1792 the company of shipbuilders
previously mentioned, Tarascon,
Berthoud, and Company, who put the first
keel-boats into business on the Ohio, built
the schooner &ldquo;Amity&rdquo; of one hundred and
twenty tons, and the &ldquo;Pittsburgh,&rdquo; a ship
of two hundred and fifty tons. In 1793 the
schooner &ldquo;was sent to St. Thomas, and the
ship to Philadelphia, both laden with Flour.
The second summer, they built the brig
&lsquo;Nanina,&rsquo; of two hundred, and the ship
&lsquo;Louisiana,&rsquo; of 350 tons. The brig was
sent direct to Marseilles; the ship was sent
out ballasted with our <i>stone coal</i>, which was
sold at <i>Philadelphia</i>, for 37 1-2 cents per
bushel. The year after they built the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
&lsquo;Western Trader&rsquo; of 400 tons.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> By 1800,
therefore, cargoes of flour, iron, beef, pork,
glass-ware, furniture of black walnut, wild
cherry, and yellow birch, and beverages of
varying character were awaiting the great
hulls of these new ships of several hundred
tons. In 1803 Thaddeus Harris found several
of these ships on the stocks at Pittsburg;
three had been launched before
April, &ldquo;from 160 to 275 tons burden.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
On May 4 he wrote at Marietta: &ldquo;the
schooner &lsquo;Dorcas and Sally,&rsquo; of 70 tons,
built at Wheeling and rigged at Marietta,
dropped down the river. The following
day there there passed down the schooner
&lsquo;Amity,&rsquo; of 103 tons, from Pittsburg, and
the ship &lsquo;Pittsburg,&rsquo; of 275 tons burden,
from the same place, laden with seventeen
hundred barrels of flour, with the rest of
her cargo in flat-bottomed boats. In the
evening the brig &lsquo;Mary Avery,&rsquo; of 130
tons, built at Marietta, set sail. These
afforded an interesting spectacle to the
inhabitants of this place, who saluted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
vessels as they passed with three cheers,
and by firing a small piece of ordnance from
the banks.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> &ldquo;The building and lading of
ships is now considered as an enterprize of
the greatest importance in this part of the
country. The last (1802) there were
launched from the ship-yard of Captain
Devol, on the Muskingum river, five miles
above its mouth, the ship &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Muskingum</span>,&rsquo; of
204 tons, owned by Benjamin Ives Gilman,
Esq. and the brigantine &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Eliza Greene</span>,&rsquo;
of 115 tons, owned by Charles Greene, Esq.
merchants at Marietta. At the spring flood
of the present year, the schooner &lsquo;Indiana,&rsquo;
of 100 tons, the brig &lsquo;Marietta,&rsquo; of 130
tons, and another of 150 tons, also built
here, were launched and descended the
river for New Orleans and the trade to the
West Indies. Good judges of naval architecture
have pronounced these vessels equal,
in point of workmanship and materials, to
the best that have been built in America.
The firmness and great length of their
planks, and the excellency of their timbers,
(their frames being almost wholly composed
of black walnut, a wood which, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
properly selected, has nearly the strength
of white oak, and the durability of the live
oak of the south without its weight) it is
believed will give these vessels the preference
over any built of the timber commonly
made use of, in any market where there are
competent judges. This part of the country
owes much to those gentlemen, who, in
a new and experimental line, have set this
example of enterprize and perseverance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
One ship from Marietta is said to have had
the existence of her port of clearance questioned
in Italy.</p>

<p>In 1811 we learn that ship-building was
not prospering as might be supposed;
misfortunes and accidents &ldquo;have given a
damp to ships building at present.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> On
an inland river, where the winds and the
amount of rainfall at any time were very
uncertain, it must have been a most
difficult thing to cope successfully with
low water and shifting sand bars and
other innumerable obstacles to navigation
in the Ohio. The times were ripe for
another power, one which did not require<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
that the vessels have deep draught, as was
the case with sailing vessels.</p>

<p>The dawning of the new era of steam
navigation cannot be introduced better than
by quoting a unique paragraph from <i>The
Navigator</i> of 1811:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is now on foot a new mode of
navigating our western waters, particularly
the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. This is
with boats propelled by the power of steam.
This plan has been carried into successful
operation on the Hudson river at New
York, and on the Delaware between New
Castle and Burlington.&mdash;It has been stated
that the one on the Hudson goes at the
rate of four miles an hour against wind and
tide on her route between New York and
Albany, and frequently with 500 passengers
on board. From these successful experiments
there can be but little doubt of the
plan succeeding on our western waters, and
proving of immense advantage to the commerce
of our country. A Mr. Rosewalt, a
gentleman of enterprise, and who is acting
it is said in conjunction with Messrs. Fulton
and Livingston of New York, has a
boat of this kind now on the stocks at Pitts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>burgh,
of 138 feet keel, calculated for 300
or 400 tons burden. And there is one
building at Frankfort, Kentucky, by citizens
who no doubt will push the enterprise.
It will be a novel sight, and as pleasing as
novel to see a huge boat working her way
up the windings of the Ohio, without the
appearance of sail, oar, pole, or any manual
labour about her&mdash;moving within the
secrets of her own wonderful mechanism,
and propelled by power undiscoverable!&mdash;This
plan if it succeeds, must open to view
flattering prospects to an immense country,
an interior of not less than two thousand
miles of as fine a soil and climate, as the
world can produce, and to a people worthy
of all the advantages that nature and art
can give them, a people the more meritorious
because they know how to sustain peace
and live independent, among the crushing
of empires, the falling of kings, the
slaughter and bloodshed of millions, and
the tumult, corruption and tyranny of all
the world beside. The immensity of country
we have yet to settle, the vast riches of
the bowels of the earth, the unexampled
advantages of our water courses, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
wind without interruption for thousands of
miles, the numerous sources of trade and
wealth opening to the enterprising and
industrious citizens, are reflections that
must rouse the most dull and stupid....
From the canoe, we now see ships of two
or three hundred tons burden, masted and
rigged, descending the same Ohio, laden
with the products of the country, bound to
New Orleans,&mdash;thence to any part of the
world.&mdash;Thus the rise and progress of the
trade and the trader on the western waters,
thus the progress of our country from
infancy to manhood, and thus the flattering
prospects of its future greatness through
the channels of the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>These words came true in a miraculously
short space of time. Previous to the adoption
of the steamboat navigation, say in
1817, the whole commerce from New
Orleans to the upper country was carried
in about twenty barges, averaging one
hundred tons each, and making but one
trip a year. The number of keel-boats
employed on the Upper Ohio could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
have exceeded one hundred and fifty, carrying
thirty tons each, and making one trip
from Pittsburg to Louisville and back in
two months, or about three voyages in the
season. The tonnage of all the boats
ascending the Ohio and Lower Mississippi
was then about sixty-five hundred.</p>

<p>In 1811 the first steamboat was constructed
at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, on
the Monongahela. Several others were
built soon after, but it was probably fifteen
years before steamboats came into such
general use as to cause any diminution in
the flat-and keel-boat navigation. These
first boats were built after models of ships,
with deep holds. They also were constructed
with low pressure engines and
heavy machinery. Hence they were useless
in low water, very hard to propel
against the current, and their carrying
capacity was greatly reduced. In order to
attain greater speed, the builders soon
made the boats long and narrow but it was
not until they came to the decision that
boats would run faster on the water than
in it, and began making them flat and
broad, that they finally got a boat capable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of carrying a thousand tons, when drawing
only four feet, and when empty only two
and one-half feet. Then with a high
pressure engine at each wheel they could
make unprecedented speed; and these boats
afforded traveling and freight accommodations
equal to any. Although the prices of
passages did not exceed hotel rates, yet
more bountifully filled tables were not to
be found on land and the boats were marvels
of splendor in their appointments.
The chief improvement made in the river
steamboats was placing one large wheel at
the stern of the boat entirely behind the
hulk and with long paddles the full length
of the beam, operated by double engines
and quartering cranks. This had the
advantage of allowing the wheel to fly in
the eddy water of the boat, while it cleared
the boat of the afterdraft. With these
improvements rapid currents and shallow
waters could be conquered.</p>

<p>In 1832 it was calculated that the whole
number of persons deriving subsistence on
the Ohio, including the crews of steam- and
flat-boats, mechanics and laborers employed
in building and repairing boats, woodcut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>ters,
and persons employed in furnishing,
supplying, loading and unloading these
boats, was ninety thousand. At this time,
1832, the boats numbered four hundred
and fifty and their burden ninety thousand
tons. In 1843 the whole number of steamboats
constructed at Cincinnati alone was
forty-five; the aggregate amount of their
tonnage was twelve thousand and thirty-five
tons, and their cost $705,000. This
gives an average of two hundred and sixty-seven
tons for each boat and about $16,000
for the cost of each.</p>

<p>The models of these 1843 boats, as well
as their finish and accommodations, evinced
a progressive improvement upon earlier
boats. They had more length and less
draught, and were faster than those of the
last generation, while the hulls were more
staunch, though they contained less weight
of timber. The cabins were not so gaudy
and expensive as those of former years but
were greatly superior in comfort and convenience.</p>

<p>In 1844 the number of steamboats employed
in navigating the Mississippi and
its tributaries was four hundred and fifty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
The average burden of these boats was 200
tons each, making an aggregate of 90,000
tons and their aggregate value, at $80 per
ton, was $7,200,000. Many of these were
fine vessels, affording most comfortable
accommodations for passengers, and compared
favorably in all particulars with the
best packets in any part of the world. The
number of persons engaged in navigating
the steam-boats at this time varied from
twenty-five to fifty for each boat, or an
average of about thirty-five persons, which
gives a total of 15,750 persons employed.</p>

<p>It appears from the reports of the Louisville
and Portland Canal at this time that
more than seven hundred flat-boats passed
that canal in one year. There were, therefore,
probably four thousand descending the
Mississippi, and counting five men to a boat
there were 20,000 persons employed in flat-boating.
The cost of these boats was in
the neighborhood of $400,000, which, as
they did not return, was an annual expense;
the cost of loading, navigating, and unloading
them approximated $900,000, making
a total annual expenditure upon this class
of boats $1,300,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>If, in 1834, the number of steamboats
on western waters was two hundred and
thirty, and they carried 39,000 tons, the
expense of running them could be estimated
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>At this time the steamboat tonnage
belonged to the internal commerce of the
country, as, with the exception of two or
three in the Gulf of Mexico, we had no
steam vessels engaged in foreign commerce.
Of the whole 218,994 tons, it appears that
two-thirds belonged to the West; and as a
portion of the other tonnage was employed
on routes leading to the West and connecting
with our highways, the commerce of
the West no doubt amounted to more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
two-thirds of the commerce of the Union.
And, estimating the number of steamboats
from their average tonnage, there must
have been in 1842, one thousand in the
United States, of which six hundred belonged
to the West.</p>

<p>The table of tonnage above given, shows
where this vast commercial marine was
employed; first, in the Mississippi Basin;
next, in the city of New York; and then
on the Lakes. From the port of New York
there were some seventy or eighty steamboats
constantly running&mdash;on the Lakes
there were hundreds. In the valley of the
Mississippi the number of steamboats they
employed was equal to the whole number
of those employed in England. This will
appear from the following statement from
McCullough&rsquo;s gazetteer of the steamboat
tonnage of Great Britain in 1834:</p>

<p>It appears then that the steamboat tonnage
of the Mississippi Valley (1842) exceeded
by forty thousand tons the entire
steamboat tonnage of Great Britain (1834).
In other words, the steamboat tonnage of
Great Britain was only two-thirds that of the
Mississippi Valley. The magnitude of this
fact will be best appreciated by considering
that the entire tonnage of the United States
was but two-thirds that of Great Britain,
showing that this proportion is exactly
reversed in western steamboat trade. The
influence of the West in pushing the
steamboat to its ultimate use as a common
carrier has been most remarkable.</p>

<h3>THREE GENERATIONS OF RIVERMEN</h3>


<p>The history of the Ohio Basin rivermen,
from those who paddled a
canoe and pushed a keel-boat to
those who labor today on our steamboats
has never been written. The lights and
shades of this life have never been pictured
by any novelist and perhaps they never
can be. Even the student who gleans
imperfect pictures from the miscellanies
preserved in local histories, must in the
very nature of the case, secure but a poor
focus on realities. Study as you will, you
will only make yourself ridiculous when
you attempt to talk to one of the old-time
rivermen. Your use and even pronunciation
of words will seem absurd; if the
dictionary is on your side, so much the
worse for the dictionary. An attempt will
create in the enthusiast much the same
feeling that will be felt on giving a veteran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of Gettysburg a copy of an historical novel
describing the battle; it may have thrilled
you but your old soldier friend will say
&ldquo;That man never was in battle.&rdquo; The
old riverman will, by his smile, make you
conscious that you speak in unfamiliar
terms, though his manner may be politeness
itself. &ldquo;You have never been in
battle&rdquo; will be the gist of his implications.</p>

<p>The first generation of rivermen, excluding,
of course the Indians, would cover the
year from 1750 to 1780 and would include
those whose principal acquaintance with
the Ohio and its tributaries was made
through the canoe and pirogue. The second
generation would stretch from 1780 or
1790 to 1810, and for our purposes will
include those who lived in the heyday of
the keel- and flat-boat. The third generation
would carry us forward from 1810 to
about 1850, and in this we would count the
thousands who knew these valleys before
the railway had robbed the steamboat of
so much of its business and pride. This
classification is extremely loose; it will
help us, however, to place some limits on
a subject as boundless as human ambition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>For, taken through the years, the human
element in the historical phases of these
valleys has remained practically unchanged.
Greed of the great round dollar has been
the commanding passion, and nowhere has
it burned more fiercely. All the crimes,
treacheries, deceptions, and frauds practiced
under the sun have been repeated on
the Ohio between Pittsburg and Cairo.
Some, perhaps unknown elsewhere, have
here been committed. But here, too, that
old-time clear love of living for life&rsquo;s sake
only, the thing which makes sailors sing the
world over, was deeply felt. In its lower
extremities the river reaches practically
southern climes while its northern arms
reach out into New York and Pennsylvania.
On its northwestern shore settled many
colonies from New England; on the south-eastern
coast flocked the Virginians. Thus,
from the standpoint of temperament, the
Ohio offers a most remarkable field of study
of human types. As said, it was the western
projection of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s Line;
but instead of being a mere geographical
technicality, it was a teeming highway
where passion, hate, love, and fraternity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
were every day displayed until the great
crisis was finally passed. For, be it remembered,
there was civil war on the Ohio
long before Fort Sumter belched its defiance
to secessionism. True, western
Virginia and Kentucky were not unbalanced
by the fervor that swept the South, but
this river highway between them and Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois (as loyal as Vermont
or Massachusetts) was the meeting-place of
hundreds who could not meet without
striking fire. Brought up in this zone
where issues were plain and where it was
not derogatory to carry a broken nose or a
blackened eye any time between 1840 and
1860, fired to fast thinking and faster action
by the passionate current in which they
lived, were many of the bravest leaders of
the Civil War, such as Lincoln, Grant, and
Sherman. Our study here has nothing
to do with the history of the Civil War,
but disclosures made at that time bring out
most plainly the position of the Ohio
Valley in the Union, and the political consequences.
It has been in place elsewhere
to define the various stocks of people who
entered the Ohio Valley a century ago and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
who have been its controlling spirits since
their entrance. Of these the rivermen
were a part, moved by one and the same
force politically. Some were of the North
and some came up from the South, and
they wrangled for years over the problems
solved by the Civil War.</p>

<p>But now, turning specifically to our
classification, let us glance at the first generation
of Ohio rivermen: those who knew
these waters before and during Revolutionary
days. At the outset it is clear that
their tasks are as strange to us as the sights
upon which their eyes feasted and the
sounds which day and night were sounding
in their ears. They were engaged in the
only trade known in the valley then&mdash;the
fur trade. At about midsummer, or a little
earlier, the fur trade of the entire Ohio
Basin focused at the mouth of the Monongahela
for transportation to Philadelphia
and Baltimore or on the lower Ohio
for shipment by canoe down the Ohio and
Mississippi. When the curtain of actual
history arose on the Ohio River, the fur
traders formed the motley background in
the drama in which C&eacute;loron, Contrec&#339;ur,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Villiers, Washington, and Gist stood out
clearly in the dark foreground. C&eacute;loron
found them here and there in 1750 and sent
them back to Virginia with a sharp letter
to Governor Dinwiddie. Indeed it was
these first rivermen who floated on the
Ohio in canoes laden with peltry who
brought on apace the Old French War.
Nominally, of course, it was that quota of
one hundred families with which the Ohio
Company promised to people its two hundred
thousand acre grant between the
Monongahela and Kanawha Rivers which
alarmed the Quebec government; but in
reality it was the Virginia and Pennsylvania
fur traders in whose canoes thousands
of dollars&rsquo; worth of beaver skins were being
kept from the St. Lawrence. From village
to village these traders passed, securing
from the natives their plunder of river and
forest. In their long canoes the packs
were carefully deposited, and payment was
made in goods, of which ammunition and
fire-arms were of most worth. Though
these were the first rivermen, they as frequently
came by land as by water. But,
when in their canoes, they were the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to ply the western rivers. They, first of
white men, learned the old-time riffles&mdash;many
of which became known to millions
by the names these first <i>voyageurs</i> gave
them. They knew islands which have long
since passed from sight; they knew the old
licks and the old trails. They practiced
the lost arts of the woodsman; they had eyes
and ears of which their successors in these
valleys do not know. They did not become
white Indians for, it would seem, they did
not mingle as closely with the red-men as
did the French; but they became exceedingly
proficient in the Indian&rsquo;s woodland
wisdom. Browned by the sun and hardened
by wind and rain and snow they were
a strong race of men; they could paddle or
walk the entire day with little fatigue.
Yet their day&rsquo;s work was not such usually
that it made mere brute machines of them.
Not as boisterous as the French on the
Great Lakes and their tributaries, these
first Americans in the West were yet a
buoyant crew; there were songs to be sung
as the canoe glided speedily along beneath
the shadows of those tremendous forest
trees; dangers intensified the joys, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
everywhere else, added a flavor to living, a
romantic tinge to what otherwise might
have been commonplace. There was no
caste, no clique, no faction; even Virginian
and Pennsylvanian eyed one another more
considerately on the Ohio than elsewhere;
true, the quarrel at last grew bitter, even
here, but it was confined to the possession
of Pittsburg and did not concern the valley
as a whole.</p>

<p>With the deepening of the struggle for
the Ohio its first generation of <i>voyageurs</i>
became of great importance. Their knowledge
of the river and the land through
which it flowed was of moment to marching
armies, scouts and spies, peace commissioners,
military superintendents, commanders
of forts, cohorts of surveyors,
land companies, investors, promoters, and
pioneers. With the passing of the fur
trade, a score of remunerative openings was
at the command of the rivermen who had
learned well his lesson. Thus with the
opening of the new era of the barge and
keel-boat the old-time <i>voyageur</i> could remain
upon the scene, or, like Daniel Boone,
paddle away to the West and in a new land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
live over again the days when the forests
were fresh and green.</p>

<p>With the filling of the Ohio Valley came
the introduction of these heavy freight
craft, the barge and flat-boat, and, almost
immediately, the keel-boat, the first upstream
craft. To row or steer a barge or
flat or to pole a keel-boat was work no
<i>voyageur</i> of earlier times had undertaken.
It was rougher work than had ever been
demanded of men in the West and it soon
developed rougher men than the West had
ever seen. Social conditions, growing
spasmodically complex in a new country,
made them worse. Once free of savage
red-men, the Ohio Valley became a famous
retreat for criminals of every class from
every state; horse thieves, gamblers, and
men guilty of far worse crimes were comparatively
safe on the Ohio by 1800; and,
in the descending barge or flat, could pass
on into a new career under new names in
Kentucky, Ohio, or beyond. Added to this
scum of the older communities must be
counted the hundreds who had served in
the western armies which were now disbanded,
many of whom bred in roughest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
surroundings now sank quickly to their
social level in the fast-filling West they had
freed. This type of hardy but vicious manhood
found hard work awaiting them on
the rivers where millions of tons of freight
were waiting to be moved. They laid
down a heavy musket and picked up a
heavier oar; but the two forms of occupation
were not dissimilar, for both offered a
life of alternate labor and rest. On these
first freight craft in the West the work was
severe in the extreme, but it was not continuous;
it was often a desperate pull today
and leisure tomorrow. A writer of a generation
ago caught the exact spirit of this
life at this transitional state:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ohio River being once reached,
the main channel of emigration lay in the
water-courses. Steamboats as yet were
but beginning their invasion, amid the
general dismay and cursing of the population
of boatmen that had rapidly established
itself along the shore of every river. The
early water life of the Ohio and its kindred
streams was the very romance of emigration;
no monotonous agriculture, no toilsome
wood-chopping could keep back the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
adventurous boys who found delight in the
endless novelty, the alternate energy and
repose of a floating existence on those
delightful waters. The variety of river
craft corresponded to the varied temperaments
of the boatmen. There was the
great barge with lofty deck requiring
twenty-five men to work it up-stream;
there was the long keel-boat, carrying
from twenty-five to thirty tons; there
was the Kentucky &lsquo;broadhorn,&rsquo; compared
by the emigrants of that day to a New England
pig-sty set afloat, and sometimes built
one hundred feet long, and carrying seventy
tons; there was the &lsquo;family-boat,&rsquo; of like
structure, and bearing a whole household,
with cattle, hogs, horses, and sheep.
Other boats were floating tin shops, blacksmith&rsquo;s
shops, whiskey shops, dry-goods
shops. A few were propelled by horsepower.
Of smaller vessels there were
&lsquo;covered sleds,&rsquo; &lsquo;ferry flats,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Alleghany
skiffs;&rsquo; &lsquo;pirogues&rsquo; made from two
tree trunks, or &lsquo;dug-outs&rsquo; consisting of
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bargemen were a distinct class of
people,&rdquo; writes Mr. Cassedy, &ldquo;whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
fearlessness of character, recklessness of
habits and laxity of morals rendered them
a marked people. Their history will hereafter
form the groundwork of many a
heroic romance or epic poem. In the
earlier stages of this sort of navigation,
their trips were dangerous, not only on
account of the Indians whose hunting-grounds
bounded their track on either
side, but also because the shores of both
rivers were infested with organized banditti,
who sought every occasion to rob and
murder the owners of these boats. Beside
all this the Spanish Government had forbidden
the navigation of the lower Mississippi
by the Americans, and thus, hedged
in every way by danger, it became these
boatmen to cultivate all the hardihood and
wiliness of the Pioneer, while it led them
also into the possession of that recklessness
of independent freedom of manner, which
even after the causes that produced it had
ceased, still clung to and formed an integral
part of the character of the Western Bargeman.
It is a matter of no little surprise
that something like an authentic history of
these wonderful men has never been writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ten.
Certainly it is desirable to preserve
such a history, and no book could have
been undertaken which would be likely to
produce more both of pleasure and profit
to the writer and none which would meet
with a larger circle of delighted readers.
The traditions on the subject are, even at
this recent period, so vague and contradictory
that it would be difficult to procure
anything like reliable or authentic data in
regard to them. No story in which the
bargemen figured is too improbable to be
narrated, nor can one determine what particular
person is the hero of an incident
which is in turn laid at the door of each
distinguished member of the whole fraternity.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The crews were carefully chosen. A
&lsquo;Kentuck,&rsquo; or Kentuckian, was considered
the best man at a pole, and a &lsquo;Canuck,&rsquo;
or French Canadian, at the oar or the
&lsquo;cordelles,&rsquo; the rope used to haul a boat
upstream. Their talk was of the dangers
of the river; of &lsquo;planters and sawyers,&rsquo;
meaning tree trunks imbedded more or less
firmly in the river; of &lsquo;riffles,&rsquo; meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
ripples; and of &lsquo;shoots,&rsquo; or rapids (French
<i>chutes</i>). It was as necessary to have violins
on board as to have whiskey and all the
traditions in song or picture of &lsquo;the jolly
boatman&rsquo; date back to that by-gone day.
Between the two sides of the river there
was already a jealousy. Ohio was called
&lsquo;the Yankee State&rsquo; and Flint tells us that it
was a standing joke among the Ohio boatmen
when asked their cargo to reply, &rsquo;Pitcoal
indigo, wooden nutmegs, straw baskets,
and Yankee notions.&lsquo; The same authority
describes this sort of questioning as being
inexhaustible among the river people and
asserts that from one descending boat came
this series of answers all of which proved
to be truthful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are you from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Redstone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is your lading?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Millstones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your captain&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whetstone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you bound?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To Limestone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the highway of emigration,&rdquo; a
pioneer has written of the Ohio in its early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
years, &ldquo;by the old and nearly forgotten flat-boat
system.... I was familiar with the
sight of these primitive navigators and
their sluggish moving vessels when in the
early spring days they came down....
I have seen several generations on a single
flatboat, from the white haired grand-sire
and his aged helpmate, seated in rude
chairs of domestic manufacture, with split
hickory bottoms, down to the infant babe
nestled in its rough hewn cradle, made by
the ax of the stalwart young man, father
to a group of little &lsquo;towheads&rsquo; who surrounded
the parents, and their small assortment
of household goods. A cow&mdash;that
domesticated helpmate to the family of the
emigrating poor&mdash;was generally tied near
the center of the flatboat, and on the lumber
or planks that were intended, when the
voyage terminated, to be made into flooring,
and combine with the broken up flat-boat
to make a quickly constructed home
at some point on the forest covered hills of
Kentucky or Ohio, or on the low, flat lands
that border the Mississippi.... They
were going to settle in the wilderness, with
a cow, a flitch of bacon, a small coop of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
chickens, and, generally, a large family of
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the heroes of the days of the
keel-boat, stands Mike Fink who, in his
own words, is described as follows: &ldquo;I can
out-run, out-hop, out-jump, throw down,
drag out and lick any man in the country.
I&rsquo;m a Salt-river roarer; I love the wimming
and I&rsquo;m chock full of fight.&rdquo; Of this
typical leader of his class an old magazine,
the <i>Western Monthly</i>, gives us this description:
&ldquo;His weight was about 180 pounds;
height about five feet, nine inches; broad,
round face, pleasant features, brown skin,
tanned by sun and rain; blue, but very
expressive eyes, inclining to grey; broad,
white teeth, and square, brawny form,
well proportioned; and every muscle of
his arms, thighs and legs, was fully developed,
indicating the greatest strength and
activity. His person, taken altogether,
was a model for a Hercules, except as to
size.&rdquo; No plucky adventure or cunning
trickery performed by bargemen from the
Hudson to the Mississippi but seems to
have been accredited by some one at some
time to Mike Fink. One of these, told of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Fink et al., is sufficiently typical to represent
the other ninety-nine. Voyaging
down the Ohio, Fink one day noticed a
flock of fine sheep on shore, and, being out
of fresh provisions, he determined to secure
a supply of mutton without the delay and
vexation attendant upon any financial
exchange. In his cargo was a number
of bladders of Scotch snuff. Obtaining
a quantity of this drug he caught a
few sheep, rubbed it on their heads and
faces, and instantly sent a messenger for
the owner whose house was not far
distant.</p>

<p>By the time this man appeared the sheep
Fink had dosed were deporting themselves
in a manner at once disgraceful to the
remainder of the flock and prodigiously
marvelous to the eyes of their dazed owner.
Leaping and bleating, the distracted animals
were pawing their heads, rubbing
them wildly on the ground and acting in
general as though possessed of devils and
on the point of dashing down the river
bank into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my sheep?&rdquo;
exclaimed the alarmed owner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; said Mike, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear of black murrain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the terrified reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;all sheep up the river&rsquo;s
got it dreadful&mdash;dyin&rsquo; like rotten dogs,
hundreds daily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell!&rdquo; cried the victim;
&ldquo;and what&rsquo;s the cure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but killin&rsquo; &rsquo;em to prevent it&rsquo;s
spreadin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s dreadful catchin&rsquo;, is black
murrain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The riverman was at once begged to kill
the infected sheep and throw their bodies
into the current of the river. Mike did not
at once agree, but when a couple of gallons
of peach brandy was named as a
consideration, he consented. And that
night as his boat left the cove its freight
was increased by many pounds of mutton
and something less than two gallons of
peach brandy. The same story is told of
other bargemen in various portions of the
Union but, whoever was guilty of the theft,
it is typical of all so far as their attitude to
the public is concerned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Such men, being constantly on the move,
were hard to place, and as difficult to bring
to justice as a government official. A keel-boat
captain surrounded by a swarthy crew
which he had treated liberally to plunder
would not be attacked by any posse in its
right mind. On one occasion&mdash;whether
or not the story is true, the spirit of it is
no misrepresentation&mdash;Mike Fink was so
earnestly desired that a reward was offered
for his capture. When his boat was anchored
at Louisville an old friend of Mike&rsquo;s,
a constable, approached him and expressed
the desire to bring him to trial in order to
obtain the promised reward. At the same
time he assured the culprit that there was
no evidence that could result in conviction.
The keel-boat man took pity on his friend
and agreed, after some consideration, to
acquiesce on one condition: he would go if
he could be drawn thither in his yawl,
surrounded by his men.</p>

<p>The condition was agreed to. &ldquo;Accordingly
a long-coupled wagon was procured,
and, with oxen attached, it went down the
hill, at Third Street for Mike&rsquo;s yawl. The
road, for it was not then a street, was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
steep and very muddy at this point. Regardless
of this, however, the boat was set
upon the wagon, and Mike and his men,
with their long poles ready, as if for an
aquatic excursion, were put aboard, Mike
in the stern. By dint of laborious dragging,
the wagon had attained half the height of
the hill, when out shouted the stentorian
voice of Mike calling to his men, &lsquo;Set
poles!&rsquo;&mdash;and the end of every long pole
was set firmly in the thick mud; &lsquo;Back
her!&rsquo; roared Mike, and down the hill again
went wagon, yawl, men, and oxen. Mike
had been revolving the matter in his mind
and had concluded that it was best not to
go; and well knowing that each of his men
was equal to a moderately strong ox, he
had at once conceived and executed this
retrograde movement. Once at the bottom,
another parley was held and Mike was again
overpowered. This time they had almost
reached the top of the hill, when &lsquo;Set
poles! Back her!&rsquo; was again ordered and
again executed. A third attempt, however,
was successful, and Mike reached the
court house in safety; and, as his friend,
the constable, had endeavored to induce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
him to believe, he was acquitted for lack
of sufficient evidence. Other indictments,
however, were found against him, but Mike
preferred not to wait to hear them tried;
so, at a given signal he and his men
boarded their craft and again stood ready
to weigh anchor. The dread of the long
poles in the hands of Mike&rsquo;s men prevented
the posse from urging any serious remonstrance
against his departure. And off
they started with poles &lsquo;tossed.&rsquo; As they
left the court house yard Mike waved his
red bandanna, which he had fixed on one
of the poles, and promising to &lsquo;call again&rsquo;
was borne back to his element and launched
once more upon the waters.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Our inability to believe such stories is
only an additional proof that those days
might as well be a cycle as a century behind
us, so far as catching the genuine atmosphere
of them is concerned. It was a
rough day on shore, a day when, so the
story goes, a Louis Phillippe could not
treat an Ohio innkeeper with hauteur (after
announcing that he would &ldquo;be King of
France&rdquo;) without being thrown into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
street to the accompaniment of the boast:
&ldquo;We are all Kings over here.&rdquo; English
travelers in the middle West have probably
left truer pictures of actual social conditions
in the days of the keel-boat and barge than
we have elsewhere. We think many of
these accounts are, like Dickens&rsquo;s <i>Notes</i>,
exaggerated. If any of them are true, all
might as well be. And, at any rate, whatever
the social average, we can be very
certain that the rivermen had the hardest
work and were the hardest type of all laborers
in the new West.</p>

<p>A hint has been dropped some pages
before about the feeling of the old-time
rivermen concerning the introduction of
steam navigation. In this series of monographs
it has been in place now and then
to refer to the anger and disgust of every
class of men engaged in land transportation
over the introduction of new methods.
The old packhorse-men were intensely
incensed at the introduction of wheeled
vehicles on the great routes of trade and
immigration, and even opposed the widening
of Indian trails and the building of
roads. The first wagons were assaulted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and demolished. In turn the &ldquo;waggoners&rdquo;
and teamsters opposed the building of
canals and the improvement of the rivers.
Teamsters, tow-boat men, and rivermen
were foremost in opposing the railway.
Something of the same spirit exists in certain
parts today, in the struggle which is
on, and which is growing more bitter each
year, between railway and electric roads.</p>

<p>The conflict between the new and the
old was probably more fierce on the rivers
than elsewhere, for the reason that one
route was common to all. The canal and
highway were not often contiguous, and the
railway was yet further removed, because
it followed the waterways which the roads
frequently avoided. On the river the
barge and steamboat moved side by side;
they landed at the same ports, and never
lost sight of each other. It was a significant
repetition of history, recalling the day
when the wheeled vehicle was introduced
on roads never used save by the packhorse-men.
In each instance improved methods
of locomotion came into violent contact
with the old. And, as in the case of the
struggle between angry packhorse-men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
wagon- and coach-drivers, the new method
was a labor-saving invention. No string
of ponies could bear what a great Conestoga
wagon would carry. It took less &ldquo;hands&rdquo;
to transport a given amount of freight on
wagons than by the old packsaddle system.
The difference in the case of barge and
flat-boat and steamboat was much more
marked and the struggle so much more
bitter. True it is that in both cases the
amount of business soon increased with improved
facilities&mdash;for the wagon was as
much in advance of the packsaddle as the
steamer was in advance of the flat-boat&mdash;but
this did not allay temporary hostility.</p>

<p>River life at once underwent a great
change with the gradual supremacy of the
steamboat in the carrying trade of the Ohio
and its tributaries. The sounding whistle
blew away from our valleys much that was
picturesque&mdash;those strenuous days when a
well developed muscle was the best capital
with which to begin business. Of course
the flat-boat did not pass from our waters,
but as a type of old-time rivermen their
lusty crews have disappeared. The business
interests of the new West, growing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
greater proportions each year, demanded
all hands &ldquo;on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with that first generation
of rivermen it was observed that social
equality was a general rule. There were
no distinctions; every man was his own
master and his own servant. In the days
of keel-boats and flat-boats conditions
changed, as we have observed in the case
of Mike Fink who was &ldquo;captain&rdquo; of his
boat and the leader of his own henchmen.
This has been touched upon in the consideration
of the evolution of river craft, and
may be suggested, only in passing, here;
the second generation of rivermen were
accustomed to obey orders of superiors, and
society was divided sharply into two
classes, the serving and the served. With
the supremacy of the steamboat this division
is reduplicated over and again; here
are found four general classes, the proprietors,
navigators, operators, and deckhands.</p>

<p>The upper ranks of the steam-packet
business have furnished the West with
some of its strongest types of aggressive
manhood. Keen-eyed, physically strong,
acquainted with men and equal to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
emergency, the typical captain of the first
half century of steamboating in the West
was a man any one was glad to number
among his friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>But between the pilot house and the deck
lay a gulf&mdash;not impassable, for it was very
frequently spanned by the worthy&mdash;deep,
and significant. Until the Civil War
&ldquo;deckoneering&rdquo; was, largely, the pursuit
of whites. A few plantation owners rented
out slaves to steamboat owners, but negroes
did not usurp the profession until they
were freed. This was contemporaneous
with the general introduction of steam
railways.</p>

<p>A heterogeneous population&mdash;not touched
in the foregoing generalizations&mdash;has made
the waters of the Ohio Basin its home.
They may be classed as vagrants, gamblers,
and banditti. The first class
would include both the indolent and the
vicious population that has swarmed the
Ohio and its tributaries from times immemorial.
In all sorts of conceivable
craft, resembling each other only in the
sole particular of buoyancy, these vagrants
have been floating our waters and mooring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
their boats along our shores for a hundred
years or more. In house-boats of all possible
sizes, shapes, heights, depths, and
stenches these idlers and triflers have lived
and trained their sons and daughters to
live. Their staple means of existence has
been fishing and filching, and, while living,
are seemingly the happiest of people
and no questions asked. To dig a few
hills of potatoes and snatch a few ears of
corn or a melon, to conciliate and lead
away a watch-dog, to &ldquo;run&rdquo; the trot-line,
to barter stolen articles in a contiguous
county, makes up the happy round of their
useless lives. If it is true that every man
is as lazy as he dare be the Ohio River can
boast the most daring set of men in the
world. It is interesting to note that at the
beginning of the last century those who
were engaged in legitimate business on
western waters were not considered as
holding a respectable social position.
&ldquo;This voyage performed,&rdquo; we read in <i>The
Navigator</i> for 1818, &ldquo;which generally occupies
three month ... the trader returns
[from New Orleans] doubly invigorated,
and enabled to enlarge his vessel and cargo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
he sets out again; this is repeated, until
perhaps getting tired of this mode of merchandizing,
he sets himself down in some
town or village as a wholesale merchant,
druggist or apothecary, practicing physician,
or lawyer, or something else, that
renders him respectable in the eyes of his
neighbors, where he lives amidst wealth
and comforts the remainder of his days&mdash;nor
is it by any known that his fortune was
founded in the paddling of a canoe, or
trafficking in apples, cider-royal, peach-brandy,
whiskey, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This refers to the early trader; the house-boater
of the later day was not, primarily,
engaged in any trade, though many were.
Nearly every kind of a shop known on
land has floated on the Ohio. As a class,
however, the proprietors of these craft
were, and are, fishermen. &ldquo;Queer people
you meet on the river,&rdquo; wrote a correspondent
who recently journeyed down the
Ohio by canoe, &ldquo;but perhaps the most interesting
of all are the &lsquo;shanty-boat&rsquo; tribe.
We had had a long, hard morning&rsquo;s pull
against head winds and had made little
progress, were behind time and were dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>couraged.
We were passing the lone
shanty-boat of a river tradesman, tied up
on shore, waiting for the wind &lsquo;to lay.&rsquo;
Chris hailed him and asked leave to boil
coffee on his stove. I expected a rebuff,
but the trader cordially invited us to &lsquo;walk
in, gentlemen; you seem ruther fagged.
Set down, set down. I seen you uns a
passin&rsquo; us above t&rsquo;other day, but this old
tortus runs night and day and gits ahead
of the rabbit sometimes while you&rsquo;re taking
a nap.&rsquo; And so the loquacious old chap
ran on. Glad of a rest, we stayed and
drifted with him some ten or twelve miles
that night, bunking on a pile of bags in a
corner. To be sure the wily old fox turned
our visit to his profit. He proved to us
plainly, by river logic, what our experience
had already shown&mdash;that we had certain
cumbrous baggage that ought to be disposed
of, and he bought it of us for a song, &lsquo;jest
to accommodate you uns, you know; I&rsquo;m
allers a-buyin&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; no-account truck,
jest to help folks out.&rsquo; Very likely! But
the information he gave proved so valuable,
his bacon tasted so good, that night
spent with him drifting and resting was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
pleasant&mdash;what did I care if it was all a
scheme to strike a trade. Long into the
night I sat with him as he steered his
clumsy craft and shouted his queerly quavered
songs. Finally he lapsed into silence.
The frogs took up the song and had a
monopoly, except for the gurgling of the
water and the distant baying of a hound.
I was just ready to feel romantic and
silently soliloquizing the moon, when I
heard a loud whisper from the other end of
the shanty-boat, as one of the trader&rsquo;s
young hopefuls said to his brother, &lsquo;Say,
Bill, let&rsquo;s take the skiff and go ashore and
steal that hound barking.&rsquo; &lsquo;Shet up, you
young rascal,&rsquo; said the old man, never
losing his good humor. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got dogs
enough a&rsquo;ready to start a Noah&rsquo;s Ark.
What do yer want with any more? You
roll in.&rsquo; Many kinds of people inhabit
these shanty-boats. These boats are built
at a cost of from twenty dollars up to two
or three hundred. The ground to build
on is free. There is no rent to pay. There
is change of air and scenery. One house
serves for winter and summer residences&mdash;the
current and towboat carrying you back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and forth. You can always be traveling,
yet always at home. Your livelihood is
gained sometimes one way, sometimes
another&mdash;who questions? A man builds
such a home, puts his family aboard; or,
if he has no family, gets a cook if he
chooses.... Then he drifts lazily during
the summer, fishing, trapping, stealing and
making his way to warmer climes as winter
approaches. Far down at New Orleans or
elsewhere, spring finds him and he sells
out to return, or tows back with some fleet
of barges, to begin again. Or a trader will
load up at Pittsburg or Cincinnati with
dry-goods, trinkets, queensware, everything,
and make his way trading with the
farmers or trappers, until at the end of the
journey he has a rich store of bartered goods
to sell ere his northward return. They are
a careless, happy-go-lucky tribe of migrants&mdash;caring
little for the morrow. &lsquo;Do
you see this little chap?&rsquo; said a big rough-bearded
fellow to me one day, as he squeezed
between his knees a fat, freckled, chuggy,
grinning little cub. &lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s five year
old, born on the river, and he likes it better&rsquo;n
any other place. Don&rsquo;t you, hey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Johnny?&rsquo; And so they eat their day&rsquo;s
food, sleep in their floating homes, saw
their old broken fiddles or pump wheezy
accordeons, and are happy. Or sometimes
as we often saw, an honest mechanic will
build a cozy floating house, furnish it in
comfortable style and moor it near his factory,
saving rent and owning his home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several significant social changes wrought
by the Civil War have been noted; it put
an end to the days of the &ldquo;coasting&rdquo; trade
of the flat-boats and to the &ldquo;deckoneering&rdquo;
of white men. It also marked the
passing of the old gambling days in the
steam-boat business. The three previous
decades were famous days for a swarm of
recognized banditti which may be said to
have almost lived upon the Ohio-Mississippi
boats. The opulence and chivalry of
Southern planters who traveled largely by
steam-packets made gambling a source of
immense revenue to such as always won.</p>

<p>It was always cards, and the steamboat
is the ideal hunting-ground of the gambler
and card-sharp; here is money, and those
who have it are utterly at leisure. Back
in the days of the third generation of river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>men,
gambling, like drinking intoxicants,
was not a social disgrace; many men of
national reputation &ldquo;sat in&rdquo; on games of
chance which are now outlawed. In such
a social atmosphere and in such environment
little wonder that the river-boats
gained most unenviable reputation, until
at last boat-owners were compelled to prohibit
all such pastimes. Gamblers at times
took possession of steamers and captains and
clerks had almost no way to protect the
passengers. It is said that sometimes as
high as ten thousand dollars and more has
changed hands in one night in games played
between sporting men and rich planters.</p>

<p>The story of one gambler&rsquo;s night is
probably typical of the roughest of this
phase, with the exception of actual murder
which was, all too frequently, the climax
of a night&rsquo;s gaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming up on the &lsquo;Sultana&rsquo; one
night,&rdquo; a gambler leaves record, &ldquo;there
were about twenty-five of the toughest set
of men as cabin passengers I believe I ever
met. They were on their way to Napoleon,
Ark. which at that time was a great
town and known as the jumping off place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
In those days these Napoleon fellows were
looked upon as cut-throats and robbers,
and thought nothing of murdering a fellow
simply to make them appear big men with
their gang. I had for a partner a man
named Canada Bill, as game a party as ever
strode the deck of a steamboat, and one of
the shrewdest gamblers I ever encountered.
As soon as supper was over this gang of
Arkansas toughs got in the cabin and of
course wanted to play cards. Bill had
opened up business in the main hall, and
a great crowd had gathered about him. I
saw that most of these devils had been
drinking, and gave Bill the nod, which he
of course understood. He only played a
short while and left the game, pretending
to be broke. Then we fixed it up that I
should do the playing and he would watch
out for any trouble. Well, the result was
I got about everything the twenty-five men
had, including their watches, and beat
some seven or eight other passengers.
The men all took it apparently good-natured
at the time, but as the night wore on and
they kept drinking from their private flasks
I made a sneak to my room and changed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
my clothes. By the back stairs I slipped
down into the kitchen and sent a man after
my partner. I had blackened my face, and
looked like one of the negro rousters. I
only had time to warn him, when a terrible
rumpus upstairs told me the jig was up,
and with their whiskey to aid them they
were searching for me, and if they caught
me it would be good day to me. I paid
the cooks to keep mum, and Bill made
himself scarce. They had their guns out,
and were kicking in the state-room doors
hunting for me. Some of them came down
on deck, and were walking back and forth
by me, cursing and threatening vengeance.
I heard one of them ask a roustabout if he
had noticed a well-dressed man down on
deck lately. He of course had not, as Bill
had gone back up the kitchen stairs, and
with these devils was raising Cain, looking
for me, and my disguise had not been discovered
under the darkness of the night.
The boat was plowing her way along up
the coast. The stevedores were shouting
to the darkies, hurrying them along with
the freight for a landing soon to be reached.
The boat&rsquo;s whistle blew, and soon she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
heading in for the shore. A crowd of these
fellows were waiting for me, as they suspected
I would try and get off. They were
looking, mind you, for a well-dressed man.
As soon as the boat landed about ten of
them, guns in hand, ran out over the stage
to shore and closely scanned the face of
every person that came off. There was a
stock of plows to be discharged from the
boat&rsquo;s cargo, and noting the fact, I shouldered
one and with it followed the long line
of &lsquo;coons&rsquo; amid the curses of the mates,
and fairly flew past these men who were
hunting me. I kept on up the high bank
and over the levee, and when I threw my
plow in the pile with the others, made off
for the cotton fields and laid flat on my
back until the boat got again under way,
and the burning pine in the torches on
deck had been extinguished. It was a close
call, I can assure you. Bill met me at
Vicksburg the next day and brought the
boodle, which we divided. He said the
crowd took lights and searched the boat&rsquo;s
hold for me after we left the landing. Bill
must have played his part well, as he told
me afterward that they never suspicioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
him. Yes, I could tell many of my exploits.
The river was for the greater portion of
my gambling career my strongest hold.
But it&rsquo;s all over now. Even should a man
strike a big winning, there are always too
many smart Alecks about, and you would
have to whack up with so many that there
would be little left for the winner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The days of gambling on the river boats
are not altogether gone but the days of the
inland-water pirate are days of the distant
past. In the time of the keel- and flat-boat
the Ohio, and its tributaries to a certain
extent, were infested with gangs of cut-throats
and robbers whose exploits challenge
the pen of a Scott. In certain
portions of the river boatmen never dared
to tie up at night, but kept their craft fairly
in the swiftest current in order to hasten
by these haunts. It was the common tradition
among boatmen that their craft floated
faster at night than in daylight; whatever
the ground for this belief, it is certain the
fastest current was all too slow if night
found a <i>voyageur</i>, for instance, in the neighborhood
of the notorious Hurricane Island
between Illinois and Kentucky. Near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
here one Wilson, according to the Kentucky
historian Collins, fitted up a &ldquo;home&rdquo; in
famed Cave-in-Rock on the Illinois shore.
This great cavern measures two hundred
feet in length, eighty in width, the entrance
being twenty-five feet high. Wilson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;place&rdquo; was known as &ldquo;Liquor Vault and
House of Entertainment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Its very
novelty attracted the attention of the boats
descending the river, and the crews generally
landed for refreshments and amusements.
Idle characters after awhile gathered
here, and it soon became infamous for
its licentiousness and blasphemy. Wilson
... formed a band of robbers, and
laid plans of the deepest villainy....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Some of the gang escaped when they
found public vengeance aroused against
them, but some were taken prisoners; Wilson
himself lost his life at the hands of one
of his own gang, tempted by the large
reward offered for his head. Not long
after, in the upper part of this mysterious
cavern, were found sixty skeletons, confirming
the tale of systematic confidence,
betrayal, and murder.</p>

<h3>THE NAVIGATION OF THE OHIO</h3>


<p>The neglect of the Ohio River by the
United States government cannot be
better suggested than by comparing
the expenditures on that river with the
appropriations for the great land thoroughfare&mdash;the
Cumberland Road. In thirty-two
years (1806-1838) the government spent
$6,823,559.52 on the Cumberland Road.
In seventy-five years (1827-1902) $6,752,042.04
was appropriated for the Ohio River
and much of that was portioned out to the
Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine with absolute
assurance when and where the first
prominent movement looking toward the
improvement of the Ohio River originated.
With the burst of population into the West
came the realization that the great waterway
was a priceless possession.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know in detail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the actual condition of the Ohio, say at the
dawning of the eighteenth century. That
it was greatly clogged with sunken logs
and protruding reefs and bars, of course,
goes without saying. Perhaps the average
stage of water was less than it is today;
and yet the vast amount of water that stood
in the tangled forests and open swamps and
meadows drained off so slowly as to maintain
a more uniform stage of water than is
true in our day of alternate flood and
drought. If less water flowed in the Ohio&rsquo;s
bed a century ago the volume was at least
more uniform than it is today.</p>

<p>As early as January 1817 a resolution was
passed by the Legislature of Ohio inviting
the co&ouml;peration of Virginia, Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, and Indiana for the improvement
of their great waterway. Virginia,
Pennsylvania, and Kentucky promptly
responded, and in 1819 a preliminary
examination was made by General Blackburn
of Virginia, General John Adair of
Kentucky, General E. W. Tupper of Ohio
and Walter Lowrie, Esq. of Pennsylvania
who made reports to their several legislatures
under the date of November 2, 1819.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
But during the generation following, each
of these commonwealths became absorbed
in internal improvements. Ohio, for instance,
between 1819 and 1844, built seven
hundred and sixty-five miles of canals costing
nearly ten millions and almost as many
miles of turnpike at a cost of four millions.
Ohio also built seventy miles of railway,
and in 1836 began to improve her most
valuable river, the Muskingum, for slackwater
navigation. Thus there was reason
enough why Ohio could not undertake the
improvement of the Ohio River. Her sister
states were equally engaged with internal
affairs, and though some steps were taken
toward surveying the Ohio along the shores
of several states the matter was left, as
should have been the case, to the general
Government.</p>

<p>This meant a long delay, but at last, in
1825, the great work was undertaken; since
1836 there has been a continual struggle to
compel the Government to do its duty by
the Ohio River and its great commerce.
In 1837 the Government commenced a
system of surveys and an improvement of
the low-water channels by means of riprap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
stone dams, arranged so as to prevent the
spread of the water by guiding and maintaining
it in comparatively narrow channels.
The work was put under the direction of
Captain Sanders of the War Department.
This system was continued at intervals
until 1844, when, the appropriation being
exhausted, the work suddenly ceased, not
to be resumed until 1866.</p>

<p>Something of the difficulties of the old
engineers may be estimated from the records
left by them concerning the various
obstructions in the Ohio River. &ldquo;Thirty
years ago,&rdquo; wrote an engineer in 1866,
&ldquo;there were considerable tracts of woods
abounding the stream ... forming dangerous
obstructions to navigation. Gradually,
since that period, the number of
settlers along the river valley has greatly
increased, and the bottom lands ... have
been cleared; so that comparatively few
trees remain that are liable to fall into the
stream. And the same is true of most of
the principal tributaries. I refer to this to
show the probability that when the present
snags and logs are removed, a slight expenditure
annually will keep the river clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of this character of obstructions.&rdquo; The
snags and logs of generations had been
almost untouched by the government&mdash;&ldquo;left
to the uncertain and unpaid-for attention
of private individuals.&rdquo; The plan
now (1866) to rid the valley entirely of
these great impediments to navigation
marks a new era in the history of the Ohio.
It was found, upon examination, that in
the six hundred odd miles between Pittsburg
and Louisville there were seventy-five
separate points where there were snags,
forty-nine &ldquo;logs and loggy places,&rdquo; twenty-eight
wrecks and seventy-two &ldquo;sunken
boats &amp;c.&rdquo; Between Louisville and Cairo
there were some sixty additional obstructions
of similar nature&mdash;a total of two hundred
and eighty-five obstruction points. A
schedule of these obstructions, between
Pittsburg and Wheeling for instance, will
be found interesting. The asterisks refer
to obstructions in or near the channel at
comparatively low water:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Sanders, in the forties, had estimated
that it cost about fifteen dollars to
remove each ordinary snag from the Ohio.
In the Mississippi the roots of snags could
be thrown into the deep pools where they
would soon become buried in mud; but on
the Ohio such pools were not frequent and
it was usually necessary to carry the roots
ashore and destroy them with gunpowder.
Sanders reported that up to September
1837 there had been three thousand three
hundred and three obstructions removed
from the Ohio. In 1839 there had been
about ten thousand removed; at which
time the work ceased. Some of the snags
were six feet in diameter at the butt and
over one hundred feet in length. In a
report in 1835, on Mississippi improvement,
Lieutenant Bowman stated: &ldquo;It is a well-established
fact that snags do not move far
from where they first fall in, the weight of
the earth attached to their roots serving as
an anchor. It is also well established that
trees which once float seldom form snags.
Admitting this, it is sufficiently evident
that if the banks are once cleared, there
can be no subsequent formation of snags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Second only to such obstructions was the
&ldquo;Falls of the Ohio,&rdquo; the one spot in all its
course of nearly a thousand miles where
steamboat navigation was impossible until
the construction of a canal, which followed
the route of the ancient portage path two
and one-half miles in length between the
present sites of Louisville and Shipping-port,
Kentucky. In this distance the Ohio
makes a fall of about twenty-five feet caused
by a ledge of rocks extending across the
river. Steamboating is impracticable here
save only when the river is at flood-tide.</p>

<p>A company was incorporated by the
legislature of Kentucky to cut a canal
around the falls in 1804, but nothing was
done until January 12, 1825, when the
Louisville and Portland Canal Company
was organized, with a capital of $600,000.
The stock was taken by about seventy persons,
residing in Kentucky, Ohio, Missouri,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland, the United
States holding 2,335 shares, and 1,665
issued to private individuals. Many difficulties
attended the construction of the
work, which was not completed until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
December 5, 1830. During the year 1831
406 steamboats, 46 keel-boats, and 357 flat-boats,
measuring 76,323 tons, passed
through the locks.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The venture was highly successful from
a financial point of view thanks to outrageous
tolls that were charged. A twenty-four
thousand dollar boat of three hundred
tons running between Cincinnati and St.
Louis expended in tolls in the Louisville
and Portland Canal in five years a sum
equal to her entire cost. &ldquo;A boat of one
hundred and ninety tons, owned at Cincinnati,
has been in the habit of making her
trips from this city to St. Louis and back,
in two weeks, and has passed the canal <i>four</i>
times in one month. Her toll, each trip,
at $60 per ton, was $114, and her toll for
one month was $456, or at the rate of $5,472
per year, which is nearly half the value of
such a boat.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>From 1831 to 1843, 13,756 steamboats
passed through the Canal, and 4,701 keel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>and
flat-boats, with a total tonnage of two
and a half million tons, netting a toll of
$1,227,625.20.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> On the stock owned by
the United States a cash dividend (to 1843)
of $258,378 was earned&mdash;$23,378 more than
the Government&rsquo;s original investment.
Other stockholders fared equally well from
this systematic highway robbery. Such a
drain on the public purse as was the Louisville-Portland
Canal in the &ldquo;good old
days&rdquo; would not be countenanced a moment
today. The canal was rebuilt and enlarged
in 1872, and in 1874 it passed into the control
of the United States by the authority
of Congress.</p>

<p>Following is a synopsis of the expenditures
on account of the canal previous to
June 11, 1874, the date when the United
States assumed complete control and management:</p>

<p>Since 1825, when the first step toward
improving the Ohio was taken, the general
plan has been to secure additional low-water
depths at islands and bars by the
construction of low dams across chutes, by
building dikes where the river was wide
and shallow, by dredging and by the removal
of rocks and snags. Various plans
of improvement were seriously mooted.
Among these Charles Ellet&rsquo;s plan of supplying
the Ohio with a regular flow of
water by means of reservoirs was strongly
urged upon the Government about 1857.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Near the same time Herman Haupt proposed
a plan of improvement by means of
a system of longitudinal mounds and cross
dams so arranged as to make a canal on
one side of the river some two hundred
feet wide, or a greater width, and reducing
the grade to nearly an average of six inches
per mile between Pittsburg and Louisville.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
A few years later Alonzo Livermore
secured a patent for a combination of
dams and peculiar open chutes through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
dams, arranged so as to retard the flow and
lessen the velocity of the water from higher
to lower pools without interfering with the
free passage of the boats through the
chutes; chutes were substituted for locks.</p>

<p>In 1866 the condition of the river improvements
and the great change in the
river trade&mdash;which loudly called for improved
methods&mdash;is tersely summed up by
Engineer W. Milnor Roberts as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the purpose intended, namely, the
making of an improved low-water navigation,
looking to a depth not exceeding two
and one-half feet, the general plan designed,
and in part executed, under the superintendence
of Captain Sanders, was judicious;
and if all the proposed dams had been
finished in accordance with his plans there
would have been a better navigation,
especially for low-water craft, than there
has been during the twenty-two years
which have elapsed since the works were
left, many of them, in a partly finished
condition. Some of these wing dams, as
might reasonably have been anticipated,
have, in the course of years, been gradually
injured by the action of floods, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some cases portions of the stone have been
removed by persons without authority, for
their own private purposes. It is important
to note the change which has taken
place in the coal trade, not only on account
of its great and increasing magnitude, but
on account of the altered system upon
which it is conducted. Formerly, and at
the time when the riprap dams were constructed,
the coal business was carried on
by means of floating coal barges, drawing
at most four feet water, which were not
assisted in their descending navigation by
steamers, and which never returned, but
were sold as lumber at their point of destination.
The increasing demand down
the river for the Pittsburg coal, the increase
in the value of lumber, and the general
systematizing of the trade, all combine to
revolutionize the mode of transportation.
It is now [1866] carried on by means of
large barges, each containing ten to twelve,
some as high as sixteen thousand bushels
of coal, which are arranged in fleets, generally
of ten or twelve barges, towed by
powerful steamers built and employed for
that special purpose. Enough of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
barges are owned by the coal operators to
enable them to leave the loaded barges at
their various points of coal delivery, down
the Ohio, or on the Mississippi and other
rivers, while they return to Pittsburg with
a corresponding fleet of empty barges, to
be again loaded, ready for the next coal-boat
freshet. As these barges, when loaded
draw from six feet to eight feet of water,
it is obvious that they can only descend
when there is what is now called a &lsquo;coal-boat
rise&rsquo; in the river&mdash;that is, a flood
giving not less than eight feet water in the
channels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This coal shipment from Pittsburg,
which in 1844 only amounted to about
2,500,000 bushels per annum, now amounts
to about 40,000,000 bushels per annum. I
have, in the special report mentioned,
referred to the construction of railroads as
having affected the business which was formerly
carried on the Ohio river during the
comparatively low water. The lower the
water, the higher the rates of freight and
passenger travel, when there was no railroad
competition; but now, when the prices
on the river during very low water approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the railroad prices, the freight, whenever
it can, will of course take the railroad, on
account of the saving of time and greater
certainty of delivery; and thousands of
passengers always prefer the railroad to the
river. But in this connection it is proper
to note that since 1844 a large local business
between various points on the Ohio, both
freight and passenger, has gradually sprung
up and become important, which scarcely
had existence at that time. The population
along the river and in the counties in
the several States bordering upon it, and
tributary to the river business, has wonderfully
increased. So that although a portion
of the river business has been attracted to
the railroad, the business of steamboats,
as a whole, independently of the coal trade,
has become much greater than it was in
1844. Meanwhile the coal business has
more than kept pace with the increase of
population and wealth along the Ohio, in
consequence of a steadily augmenting
demand for the Pittsburg coal on the Mississippi
and other western rivers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>The method of inland navigation by
means of slackwater formed by dams passable
by locks was early proposed for the
Ohio River after the first experiment
made of this method on the Green River,
Kentucky, in 1834-36 by Chief Engineer
Roberts. The successful operation of this
system on the Monongahela and Muskingum
Rivers exerted a powerful influence
in its favor, and for many years its
adoption on the Ohio was urged patiently
though unsuccessfully. At last the important
matter was advocated with success,
and in 1885 the first of a series of locks
and movable dams was erected at Davis
Island, four and one-half miles below
Pittsburg. The work now is rapidly being
completed, the plan being to give a minimum
depth of six feet of water in the
Ohio by means of thirty-eight dams and
locks between Pittsburg and the mouth of
the Great Miami, below Cincinnati. This
form of improvement will of course be extended
in time to the mouth of the Ohio.</p>

<p>From past experience with dams in the
river, the cost of locks is estimated as
follows:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>For an average lock of six hundred feet
length and one hundred and ten feet
width, with navigable pass of six hundred
feet length, and with weirs of two hundred
and forty feet available openings, all
arranged to provide six feet navigable
depth in the shoalest parts of the improved
channels of the pools, with an
average lift at each dam of seven and two-tenths
feet:</p>

<p>But the extra width and height of lock
esplanade filling, extra length of weirs,
and extra channel dredging, incident to
the individual locations of the dams, increase
the above estimates to final totals of
from nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars
to one million, one hundred thousand
dollars at the individual dams.</p>

the Ohio River from 1827 to 1902 are as
